president’s welcome
3  2018 national women’s studies association conferencefall 2018
welcome to the 2018 nwsa in atlanta!
this is my last year as president and i am so honored by what we have accomplished in such  
a short time. last year’s conference inspired by combahee was stellar and this year’s conference promises to match it, guided by the theme: “just imagine. imagining justice: feminist visions  of freedom, dream making and the radical politics of futures.” in collaboration with my amazing  co-chair, premilla nadasen, our review team and staff, we have assembled a program that  is striving forward.
to say nothing of the hundreds of workshops, panels and roundtables highlighting some of the 
most pivotal and provocative new scholarship in the field, we have an unprecedented lineup of keynote, plenary and presidential sessions featuring feminist literary icon alice walker; legendary activist and intellectual angela davis; an opening keynote conversation between elizabeth alexander and alondra nelson; as well as the participation of ruth wilson gilmore, madonna thunder hawk, cathy cohen, tourmaline, dean spade, beth e. richie, keeanga-yamahtta taylor, chandra talpade mohanty and more. we will also infuse special presentations of visual and performance arts into the program as we turn our collective focus to envisioning futures.
building upon our work last year, we have again invited a cohort of activists and policymakers  
to join us because we are convinced that our organization can benefit from their presence  and contributions. the research and writings of our colleagues is a critical ingredient for a revived feminist movement. feminist thinkers are the center of some of the most dynamic “freedom-making” work in the u.s. and around the world from mississippi to miami, and from port au prince  to mumbai.
please enjoy this conference to the fullest. take this opportunity to forge new relationships  
and explore potential collaborations. we will welcome a new roster of leaders to the governing council and executive committee of nwsa this year, in addition to new staff. we are excited about the possibilities ahead, and i personally thank all of my brilliant and hard-working predecessors and current collaborators, including staff and members of the organization.  mel michelle lewis deserves a special shout-out for stepping in as our interim executive director this summer with the support of outgoing staff, as well as noor shawaf and current staffer  and former intern, zed seward.
i look forward to seeing you throughout the conference and in the years to come.with gratitude for the opportunity to serve this term.sincerely, 
barbara ransby

friday, november 9, 2018  
at 12:30 pm
hilton atlanta, grand ballroom
this panel consists of feminists who were at the cutting edge 
of the anti-war, anti-racist and anti-imperialist movements of the 1960s and early 70s. collectively they witnessed and participated in some of the most pivotal social movements and events of their generation: wounded knee, the takeover of alcatraz, the black panther party, the growing and changing women’s movement, the world communist movement, the u.s. anti-war movement, the palestine solidarity movement, and more. we have asked them to assess the significance of that historic year of struggle, from mexico to chicago, from paris, to palestine. for those who witnessed these events, we will invite reflections – after marching, planning, strategizing, and organizing in 1968 – where did you think the world would be in 2018? where are we? what do you see looking forward? how has your understanding of radical feminist politics informed your world view?

future of gender
saturday, november 10, 2018  
at 2:45 pm
hilton atlanta, grand ballroom
a rich body of scholarship on sexuality and gender pushes us to 
think of what the future holds in fundamental ways: what are the implications for our freedom dreams if we can create spaces to truly reimagine gender and sexuality? conversely, can we do so in the larger context of racial capitalism and hetero-patriarchy which often has a stranglehold on our collective imagination? how do we think of gender now in terms of identity, proximity to power, fluidity vs. binary? how might that framework evolve? how does gender fit into the larger matrix of power, freedom of expression, state violence and the biopolitics of the 21st century? what is/should be the role, if any, of the state and various institutions in defining gender and in the protection of group and individual rights? what does a radical trans politic look like and what does it offer to the trajectory of freedom-making in the coming decades? how do we assess “lesbian” politics in a society that is not only homophobic and transphobic, but patriarchal and misogynist? to what extent  are we sometimes conflating identity with politics?  scholar-activists working in law, culture and performance, political science, and gender, women’s and sexuality studies  will address these critical questions.

narrating love and violence: 
women contesting caste, tribe, and state in lahaul, india

2:30 to 3:45pm
room 209-211
narrating love and violence: 
women contesting caste, tribe, 
and state in lahaul, india is the first ethnographic exploration of women’s stories from the himalayan valley of lahaul, in the region of himachal pradesh, india. the book focuses on how both love and violence emerge and function at the intersection of gender, tribe, caste, and the state in india. bhattacharya privileges the everyday lives of women marginalized by caste and tribe to show how state and community discourses about gendered violence serve as proxy for caste in india, thus not only upholding these social hierarchies, but also enabling violence. bhattacharya centers lahauli women’s narratives  as a site of knowledge demonstrating how women on the margins of tribe and caste know both love and violence  as agents wishing to re-shape discourses of caste, tribe  and community.

4:00 to 5:15pm
room 209-211
embodied reckonings examines 
the political and cultural 
aspects of contemporary performances that have grappled with the history of the “comfort women,” the japanese military’s euphemism for the sexual enslavement of girls and young women—mostly korean—in the years before and during world war ii. long silent, in the early 1990s these women and their supporters initiated varied performance practices—protests, tribunals, theater, and memorial-building projects—to demand justice for those affected by state-sponsored acts of violence.
based on extensive archival and ethnographic research, the 
study argues for the central role of performance in how korean survivors, activists, and artists have redressed the histories—and erasures—of this sexual violence. merging cultural studies and performance theory with a transnational, feminist analysis, the book illuminates the actions of ordinary people, thus offering ways of reconceptualizing legal and political understandings  of redress that tend to concentrate on institutionalized forms  of state-based remediation.

(dis)ability, race, and gender in black women’s speculative fiction

9:30 to 10:45am
204-205 (lcd)
sami schalk’s bodyminds reimagined generates a rich and 
necessary conversation between black feminist thought and disability studies, bringing these two seemingly disparate fields together at the site of black women’s contemporary speculative fiction. looking to octavia butler, nalo hopkinson, n.k. jemisin, phyllis alesia perry, and shawntelle madison, schalk amplifies the power, potential, and pleasures of literary worlds in which given hierarchies of race, gender, and ability no longer hold traction. using non-realist devices such as time-travel, shape-shifting, and non-human characters, these black women writers re-imagine the possibilities and meanings attached to bodyminds—what schalk defines as the mutual imbrication of the mental and physical—and in so doing, provoke us to question governing assumptions around (dis)ability, race, gender, and sexuality. bodyminds reimagined thus foregrounds the disruptive capacity of black women’s speculative fiction to challenge the rules of reality, bringing us into contact with worlds that productively defamiliarize our own.

home to established african

communities, washington, d.c., offered women in the new negro movement a unique setting for the fight against racial and gender oppression. colored no more traces how african american women of the late-nineteenth and early twentieth century made significant strides toward making the nation’s capital a more equal and dynamic urban center. drawing from these differing but interconnected african american women’s spaces, this book excavates a multifaceted feminist, cultural history of struggle toward a vision of equality that could emerge and sustain itself. upward mobility to equal citizenship for african american women encompassed challenging racial, gender, class, and sexuality status quos. colored no more maps the intersection of these challenges and their place at the core of new negro womanhood.

204-205 (lcd)
this book examines the impact 
of women’s experiences, internal politics and political repression 
on the evolution and dissolution of the black panther party in oakland, california. spencer shows how members interpreted, implemented, and influenced party ideology and programs, how they dialogued about gender politics, and organizational priorities. challenging the belief that the panthers were a projection of the leadership, spencer draws on interviews with rank-and-file members, fbi files, and archival materials to examine the impact the organization’s internal politics and cointelpro’s political repression had on its evolution and dissolution. spencer also centers gender politics and the experiences of women and their contributions to the panthers and the black power movement as a whole, providing a panoramic view of the party’s organization over its  sixteen-year history.

black on both sides identifies 
multiple intersections between blackness and transness from the mid-nineteenth century to 
present-day anti-black and anti-trans legislation and violence. the book takes as its archive an eclectic collection of materials, including late 19th century sexological texts, plantation medical records, fugitive slave narratives, afro-modernist literary productions, documentary films, and mid-twentieth century journalistic accounts of black trans people and critically engaging black queer studies, black feminist theory, disability theory, and transgender studies, the book demonstrates how race figures prominently in the development of the category of transgender. and how blackness finds articulation in and through transness. reconstructing these theoretical and historical trajectories furthers our imaginative capacities to conceive more livable black and trans worlds.

anchored in the lives of filipina 
migrants and their families in the 
philippines, this book makes visible the various forms of care work required in the maintenance of the transnational family; demonstrating just how many people are uniquely affected by migration and separation. in accordance with subtheme two, the book critically rethinks how members of transnational families are actively crafting radical family forms under the current neoliberal moment that force their separation. it pays attention to how technology render filipina migrants as skype mothers while they forge solidarity among each other through their structural positions as precarious workers, undocumented people and transnational mothers. the book’s feminist and participatory qualitative research with filipino migrant organizations offers new avenues of collaboration towards movement-building of filipino domestic workers in nyc and transnational connections to liberation movements in the philippines. what emerges is a fascinating portrait of today’s transnational and transnational activists: migrant women.

macarena gómez-barris traces the political, aesthetic, and

11:00am to 12:15pm
room 204-205 (lcd)
this session will look at the intricate 
nexus between state repression in the form of cointelpro, harassment of pro palestine activists, censorship of campus anti-racist activists, and the violence suppression of the movements against settler colonialism from what is now the united states to palestine. repression never occurs without a response and it is in fact often a reaction to the growing strength of opposition and revolutionary movements. in this context solidarity is vital; from the cubans and algerians who gave safe haven to u.s. political exiles to those who stood with indigenous folk at alcatraz, wounded knee and standing rock. the current attacks on black freedom activists in the form of the fbi’s “black identity extremists” adds another layer that will be discussed. college campuses have been one important site of repression, resistance and solidarity: from mills college and san francisco state in the 1960s to the harassment of progressive and radical professors today and responses to it. this panel will wrestle with these important themes from their experiences in the u.s., london and around the globe.

feminists of color have been in the 
forefront of the prison abolition movement in the u.s. groups like critical resistance and incite were foundational in redefining the movement against violence and shifting strategies and analyses away from carceral solutions and punitive practices toward restorative and transformative justice solutions.the movement to “make prisons obsolete” as angela davis describes it, is grounded in an intersectional approach which looks at the relationship between prisons, carcerality, race, class, gender, sexuality, nationality  and disability. this special panel features prominent thinkers and organizers that can help us imagine  a non-carceral future.

black lives matter is a movement that 
has been led largely by black feminist and queer organizers. challenging police violence, economic injustice as well as the “politics of respectability,” organizations like black youth project 100 define their work as operating through a black queer feminist lens. charlene carruthers, founding director of byp100 and one of the leaders of the larger movement for black lives has written an insiders account of the goals and evolution of the movement, unapologetic. barbara ransby, historian, and longtime feminist activist, and current president of nwsa,  has published making all black lives matter, framing the movement in the context of a larger black feminist and radical tradition. and independent scholar and activist robyn maynard is author of policing black lives: state violence in canada from slavery to the present, which chronicles the long history of anti-black racism and repression there. three prominent authors and organizers, who have published their own books on this and related matters, will offer comment and join in a roundtable conversation on reading black lives matter and racist state violence in the u.s. and canada from  a radical feminist perspective.

this year, the committee unanimously 
awards the nwsa graduate scholarship to jallicia jolly (university of michigan, american culture). the committee unanimously grants honorable mention to jaimee swift (howard university, political science) and julia gutierrez (arizona state university, women and gender studies). the committee commends these scholars for their cutting-edge research that enhances the nwsa mission to advance feminist scholarship that is comparative, global, intersectional, and interdisciplinary.

scholarship recipient
jallicia jolly, university of michigan 
(american culture)
dissertation title:  “i’m not sick!”  
a critical embodiment of illness, sexuality, 
& self- making among hiv-positive jamaican women
jallicia jolly’s dissertation project, i’m 
not sick,” is the very first study of hiv positive women in the anglophone caribbean. this interdisciplinary and cutting-edge project studies the connections between gender, sexuality, and hiv, and the politics of care and self-making in the everyday lives of hiv-positive afro-jamaican women. based on fourteen months of fieldwork, “i’m not sick” joins oral history, focus groups, archival research, and ethnographic methods with cultural studies, and critical race and feminist theories. jallicia’s project is particularly necessary because it highlights afro-jamaican women’s experiences and strategies living with hiv and navigating the complicated and, often, contradictory relationships between their own communities, and community based health institutions and the state. jallicia argues that women’s lived-experiences reveal how they use community health work to create alternative sites for self-definition and political participation as they navigate restrictive state and institutional spaces. jallicia plans to use the funds from this award to conduct archival research at the centers for disease control’s division of global hiv & tb and the holdings in hiv/aids and stds.  this will allow her to examine the u.s. domestic and international hiv/aids policy in jamaica and the broader caribbean region.

dissertation title: on a black brazilian 
radical feminist politics: afro-brazilian 
women, police brutality and anti-lgbtq+ violence in salvador da bahia, brazil
in this important and expansive project, 
swift explores the race, sex, and gender valences of political and social activism in a site context of the african diaspora. she examines the work of afro-brazilian women activists countering anti-lgbtq+ violence and gendered-racialized state-sanctioned violence. expanding beyond statistical analyses focused exclusively on violence against afro-brazilian men and boys, swift centers the afro-brazilian women, trans*, gay, and lgbt experiences which, she argues, are largely overlooked in global discourse. ultimately, swift works to “advance a black brazilian radical feminist and queer theorization and praxis on how police violence impacts afro-descendent women and lgbtq+ communities in brazil.” through historiographic and ethnographic approaches, this exciting project examines how afro-brazilian women’s activism has been a crucial, if undertheorized, political force since the 1980s, and demonstrates how attention to this key site of work expands our understandings of racial, gender, class structures, state-sanctioned and sexual violence, and anti-trans and lgbt violence in a global context.julia gutierrez, arizona state university 
(women and gender studies)
dissertation title:  we identify as poor 
because of the money we earn not because 
of the way we live”: perceptions and experiences of poverty among mexican immigrant women on the southwest side  
of chicago
gutierrez’s exciting project brings 
together the fields of migration and poverty studies through a transnational feminist framework. this project examines the ways that mexican migrant women perceive and experience poverty in an urban neighborhood on the southwest side of chicago. using a transnational feminist framework, gutierrez examines the structural and systemic nature of u.s. urban poverty among mexican migrant women. gutierrez’s project is particularly crucial during this time of heightened contestation around issues of migration and immigration, while far less focus have been given to u.s. poverty in the national discourse. thus, in her mixed methods study, gutierrez highlights migrant mexican women’s perceptions of the urban poverty in which they live. furthermore, this study also illuminates the ways that mexican migrant women navigate through and claim space within their inner-city and low income neighborhoods. although gutierrez focuses on a mexican migrant community in the u.s., this very important study will make critical contributions to how we think about migration, immigration, and poverty throughout the globe.

everyday sustainability: gender justice 
and fair trade tea in darjeeling (state university of new york press, 2017)
everyday sustainability is a fantastic 
and strong ethnography looking  into problems of microcredit.  it makes an important intervention in the field of ‘fair trade,’ and provides novel contributions to the 
discourse on helping or empowering women workers in india (and elsewhere). this book offers a textured critique of so-called fair trade economic models through a post-colonial, feminist framework. it offers an extensive review of feminist research methods grounded in ethnography. this is a lucid book based on over ten years of research. its success as a text relies on an approachable use of theory and highly precise writing. everyday sustainability is an excellent achievement in  feminist ethnography.

pushing in silence: modernizing 
puerto rico and the medicalization of childbirth (university of texas press, 
2017)
pushing in silence achieves a deft 
intertwining between analyses of childbirth, colonialism, and modernity as social processes in puerto rico. it makes an important contribution to the history of 
medicine in puerto rico and the united states in relation to formations of gender, childbirth, and motherhood in the context of u.s. colonialism. very well researched, the book makes extensive use of archives and primary sources. the book also fills gaps in the literature on modernization and reproductive technologies and lays the comparative historical groundwork for important future work on current trends in childbirth, reproduction, surgical intervention, and the medicalization  of motherhood. pushing in silence is a watershed text in  feminist scholarship on puerto rico. 2018 gloria e. anzaldúa book prize

post-borderlandia: chicana  
literature and gender variant  
critique (rutgers university  
press, 2018)
post-borderlandia is both playful 
and profound. its poetic language moves from morose considerations of the accidented and brief lives of queer chicanx theorists; to the still 
irreverent cultural politics of gender variance; and the cheeky, sexy, raucous fun of hybrid, border-queer poetics. at times reminiscent of anzaldúa’s own writing, this book offers fresh meditations on gender, structural violence, and queer chicanx intellectual production that cast new light on crucial legacies. post-borderlandia is a fun, intimate, and smart approach to the legacy of gloria anzaldúa and other queer border thinkers that dares to theorize the ‘post-borderlands’ moment, even as border violence and anti-immigrant sentiment intensify in the us and around the world. post-borderlandia confronts difficult problems in latinx culture, but also lovingly and humorously reminds us of the power and beauty of our intellectual and artistic communities  
in resistance.

the gender effect: capitalism, 
feminism, and the corporate politics of development (university of california 
press, 2018)
the gender effect offers a sharp 
and insightful analysis of the corporate-led emphasis on girls’ education among development agencies in the early twenty-first 
century. kathryn moeller’s thoughtful use of theoretical insights illuminates postcolonial racial politics and neoliberal feminist origins of these efforts, and her attention to elite corporate and government policymakers as well as on-the-ground implementation illustrate the profound contradictions at the center of twenty-first century approaches to global poverty.

the cost of being girl: working teens 
and the origins of the gender wage gap (temple university press, 2017)
ain the cost of being a girl, 
yasemin besen-cassino draws  on both quantitative and qualitative data to explore the kinds of work american teenagers do and how their employers interpret and treat 
that labor. the result is a convincing and illustrative analysis that reveals how the informal and formal youth labor markets provide dramatically different experiences for boys and girls. the book offers new insight into the surprisingly early onset of the gender wage gap.

assembling asian america: psychological technologies  
and queer subjectivities
wen liu’s assembling asian america: psychological 
technologies and queer subjectivities is an insightful, thought-provoking, and well-written book-in-progress. the book manuscript grows out of liu’s dissertation, “cruising borders, unsettling identities: toward a queer diasporic asian america.” assembling asian america is at once interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary. although social psychology becomes an anchoring for analysis, liu carefully brings together multiple methods, theoretical frameworks, and conceptual paradigms to provide a refreshingly original examination of contemporary asian american-ness. this book manuscript provides a multi-pronged analysis of political agency as well as of “asian american” as a distinct cultural and cognitive population.

indians on indian lands: intersections of race, caste, and indigeneity
nishant upadhyay’s indians on indian lands: intersections of race, caste, and indigeneity, is a powerful proposal for a book that grows out of the author’s 2016 dissertation, “we’ll sail like columbus”: race, indigeneity, settler colonialism, and the making of south asian diasporas in canada. upadhyay’s ground-breaking analysis of south asian diaspora powerfully challenges the hegemonic focus on dominant caste experiences of racial victimization to the exclusion of south asian diasporic complicity in reproducing settler colonialism, anti-blackness and casteism. it is a remarkable instance of how feminist scholarship advances non- disciplinary thought and practice by holding anti-settler colonialism, anti-blackness and anti-caste analytics together, whilst making a contribution to post/colonial studies, transnational feminism and south asian diaspora studies.

jasbir puar,  rutgers university
the right to maim: debility, capacity, 
disability (duke university press, 2017)
the right to maim marks a paradigm 
shift in thinking fully about the global politics of disability and capacity. puar argues that debilitation and the 
state production of disability are biopolitical projects both useful and productive for states under neoliberal capitalism.  
weaving disability studies together with queer theory, transgender studies, biopolitics and assemblage theory, puar moves from the racialized constitution of transgender through  
the israeli occupation of palestine, focusing on what it means  
to manipulate bodies on the population level, neither through  
the production of life nor death in the classic foucaultian sense, but with an eye toward debilitating an entire class for social, political or economic gain. a major milestone book across multiple disciplines, with much to teach us about contemporary disability politics.
subini ancy annamma,  university

the pedagogy of pathologization:  
dis/abled girls of color in the school-
prison nexus (routledge, 2018) 
in the pedagogy of pathologization: 
dis/abled girls of color in the school-prison nexus, annamma uncovers the policies and practices that remove multiply-marginalized girls from education, targeting 
them instead for punishment and incarceration. drawing on the trajectories of incarcerated girls in the 21st century us, annamma argues for greater attention to the interweaving of ableism, racism, and sexism in carceral logics. “disability,” this timely book demonstrates, can be used simultaneously as a tool of  
removal or a marker of pride, as a catalyst for increased  
access to education or a justification for heightened  
surveillance and control.

2018 theme: feminist education and activism: teaching 
k-12 students about the importance of freedom, dream making, and the radical politics of (imagined) futures
the josephine st. pierre ruffin k-12 feminist teacher pre-
conference is an interactive pedagogy and activism workshop designed to engage elementary through secondary classroom teachers with the nwsa annual conference and its themes. this pre-conference serves as nwsa’s recognition of the importance of curriculum design and content in schools and the support of teacher professional development as critical feminist issues. in committing to the support of k-12 feminisms and education, the pre-conference workshop provides teachers with ways in which to apply feminist theory and content to their classroom practice; complimentary access to the conference at large; and other feminist resources--including the scholarly meridians journal; gender, racial, and social justice training; and networking opportunities with experts in education and activism, especially those with a focus on feminist theory, women of color feminisms and intersectionality, as well as youth studies research
the pilot initiative for this k-12 teacher pre-conference was 
launched as the josephine st. pierre ruffin teach-in program (jrtp), at nwsa’s “forty years since combahee” conference in baltimore, md in 2017 . continuing the legacy of the work at the jrtp and its namesake, josephine st. pierre ruffin, in 2018, it was renamed and relaunched as the josephine st. pierre ruffin k-12 feminist teacher pre-conference. the focal point of this teacher pre-conference will be the training of educators in how to teach feminist content, theory, and activism effectively in the classroom in an effort to gauge and enhance their students’ gender, racial, and political awareness and critical consciousness.teaching gender and sexual justice: arab and muslim 
communities institute  
thursday nov 8 2018  
1:00 to 5:00pm 
room 308
director:
 ■rabab ibrahim abdulhadi, san francisco state university
this four hour institute will create a transnational feminist setting 
that enlists multiple co-learning pedagogies, class material (text, genre, inter and multi-disciplinary, etc.), and facilitators. the institute is geared toward educators (high school and college) who might be well-versed in gender and sexuality studies but are not as familiar with arab and muslim communities.
teaching gender and sexual justice: arab and muslim 
communities is grounded in historical and contextual understandings of colonialism/settler colonialism/neocolonialism, racism, exclusion, displacement, war and imperialism not only theoretically but in pedagogical praxis and the lived experiences of marginalized communities and the mobilizing resilience and resistance strategies they employ toward social transformation. finally, the institute on teaching gender and sexual justice: arab and muslim communities will explore how such dialectical and interconnected conceptual framing intervenes in and outside formal and informal classrooms, the streets, community spaces, prisons and detention centers to arrive at transformative and non-exceptionalizing vision of justice, dignity and peace for all our communities.history of nwsa women of color caucus
39  2018 national women’s studies association conferencea brief (and incomplete) history  
of the nwsa women of color caucus
participants in the 2007 nwsa women of color caucus 
retreat discussed the central role women of color have played in nwsa history and activities, and wanted to establish a record of those contributions. pat washington and nupur chaudhuri have begun that work here. the history of the women of color caucus of the national women’s studies association is an inexorable and irreducible part of the history of nwsa. from the association’s first national conference in 1979 (lawrence, kansas)—when the women of color caucus drew its first breath as the “third world caucus”— to the landmark 1981 storrs conference (“women respond to racism”); to the watershed 1990 akron conference where over a hundred women of color and their allies walked out to protest the association’s entrenched racism; to the “healing” presidencies of vivien ng and betty harris (1994 and 1997 , respectively); to the 2000 simmons conference developed and delivered by the caucus’s advisor/benefactor/champion/mainstay christina brinkley; to the 2002 las vegas conference where the women of color caucus and the then-newly-constituted anti white supremacy task force joined forces to agitate for the inclusion of perspectives and contributions of women of color in the association’s 25th anniversary celebration; down to the present time when the women of color caucus and the women of color leadership project figure prominently in the association’s multiyear ford foundation capacity-building grant, the women of color caucus has been a driving force within the association. 
the caucus has benefited from the courage, persistence, and 
commitment of many “sturdy bridges” of all colors. several such “bridges” are listed by name in the above highlights of caucus history. however, there is a long succession of others, leading from the association’s inaugural conference to the present day, and stretching well into the future. 
nupur chaudhuri was present at the first national conference, 
where she recalls “many american women of color and other long time u.s. residents were ‘congratulated’ by their white peers for ‘speaking good english’ or having ‘a good grasp  of the subject matter.’” chaudhuri was elected that year as  one of the coordinating council members of the fledgling  third world caucus, and, in this role, she drafted guidelines for a more inclusive 1980 conference in bloomington, as well as helped set the stage for the ground-breaking storrs conference on racism in 1981. it was regarding the experience of women of color at this latter conference that chela sandoval would subsequently write, “to be ‘third world’ meant... first, to have been de-centered from any point of power in order to be used as the negative pole against which the dominant powers can then define themselves [and] second, to be working politically to challenge the systems that keep power moving in its current patterns, thus shifting it onto new terrains...” 
sandoval’s assessment of the dialectic between “third world” 
women’s status (“de-centered”) and their purpose (“shifting power...onto new terrains”) captures the essence of what the women of color caucus has been historically and what it strives to be today.
the women of color caucus continues to offer our association 
a singular opportunity to look within our own ranks to discover ways to promote broader inclusion of historical, social, cultural, political, and economical perspectives of racialized women in the united states (and abroad). we do this in a variety of ways with a variety of supporters and allies. recent examples include our work with program administration and development to create the women of color leadership project, our work with the nwsa journal to develop a cluster of articles by emerging and established women of color scholars, our work with abafazi journal to fund a women of color student essay award (subsequently expanded to several awards through the generous contributions of donors), our work with the anti white supremacy task force to present an annual “stop dreaming/keep working” workshop, and numerous other endeavors.
nwsa can be proud of this history of women of color, allies, 
and social justice advocates who have openly challenged, critiqued, and moved the association to live up to its mission. nwsa receptions and events

what does equity and justice look 
like at primarily white institutions (pwis)? traditionally, institutions that rely on “diversity” have not delivered for those at the margins. decolonizing pedagogies is an intervention in faculty and staff development that seeks to transform the curriculum, teaching, programming, operations, and culture of historically white colleges and universities. the project adopts a developmental approach that places self-reflection, collaborative intellectual inquiry, and the student experience at the center. for this session, we will be modeling what this project looks and feels like by asking directors meeting participants to engage with a set of readings and show up to the session with responses to prompts.

“whiteness” of wgs and/in the university--even as the field purportedly critiques whiteness in/of other locations. panelists explore how taken-for-granted assumptions about white normativity/ies continue to circulate and function in wgs, in spite of its antiracist claims, and look at how ” institutional structures and program administration, leadership and hiring procedures, curricular decisions (including cross-listing policies), and pedagogical practices so often perpetuate rather than decenter whiteness in wgs.

 ■melissa ooten, university of richmond
this interactive workshop will discuss 
elements of a program model that amplify wgss learning and support feminist activism. as directors of an undergraduate program that explicitly connects women, gender and sexuality studies coursework to praxis both in  and out of the classroom, we will  discuss aspects of this program that  are particularly effective and transferable, namely:
a course assignment that centers 
informed action and inclusive group process, enabling students to both gain social justice advocacy tools and put them into practice. 
a multifaceted internship requirement 
that centers intersectionality.
mechanisms to support student activism 
outside of the classroom.”

a prevailing progress narrative in our 
field celebrates obtaining department status. as we imagine our futures, how are our notions of institutional success shifting? this session invites conversation about the extent to which stand-alone departments occupy our visions, and continues the dialogue from last year’s pad roundtable “the urge to merge.” panelists engage the abstract principles and strategic considerations that inform our reconfigurations and reimagined programs, departments, interdisciplinary units, etc. presenters include those who seek to form a freestanding department or have recently made this transition, as well as those for whom department status is not a goal.

this roundtable explores the relationship 
between service roles performed by women, and faculty of color in the academy and their relationship to tenure, and promotion processes. a number of recent studies have shown clear gender and racial inequity in terms of commitments to service obligations at the department, and university levels. faculty also report a disharmony of messages from department-level and administration-level about the value of service. participants will share experiences on their own campuses, and discuss together possible ways to make meaningful changes to current practices of hiring, mentoring, retention, service, tenure and promotion.

bridging the gap between theory  
and practice, this workshop seeks  to engage and integrate political (non-academic) and scholarly (academic) work and assess through dialogue the attitudes and impact of women’s resource centers from a multicultural  and social justice perspective.
centering (queer) black feminist 
theoretical frameworks, this workshop seeks to illustrate different strategies for engaging diverse publics by attending to distinctive constellations of purpose, audience, content and form.
additionally, highlighting social work 
ethics and sociological values, this discussion symbolizes the plural, intersectional and multilayered aspects of otherness across identity, role,  and institution.wc004. how to cultivate students

10:30am - 12:00pm

presenters
 ■tolulope taiwo, pacific lutheran university
 ■saiyare refaei, pacific lutheran university
although institutions of higher 
education have a desire to promote “inclusive practices,” they often ignore experiences of those who hold marginalized identities, including women of color and non-binary folks of color inside and outside of the university. women’s centers and diversity centers can better stand in solidarity with folks of color by creating spaces that focus on collaborative meaning-making and radical self care. in this session, presenters will discuss their centers’ first sista circle leadership retreat, an initiative that centered the voices of women and non-binary students and community members of color at a predominantly white institution (pwi).

women’s centers respond to ever-
evolving needs related to gender equity. the diversity of college students requires women’s centers to rethink the ways they support students, staff and faculty; engage in knowledge production; and contribute to the creation of a just world. this roundtable asks who do women’s centers serve? how has the work of women’s centers expanded to include new ways of thinking, being and doing? participants will discuss programming and support for indigenous women and women of color, peer educator programs, partnerships with women’s athletics, self-care/healing arts programming, inclusive sexuality education, masculinity programming, and partnerships with women in stem.

of cohorts that support and center women of color in college and university women centers. it will demonstrate how cohorts that support women of color act as counterspaces that afford opportunities for resistance, transformation, and healing for students and the advocates who lead such programs. participants will also learn the steps necessary in creating such opportunities on their campuses in pre-conference53

 ■kristi brian, college of charleston gender and sexuality equity center
 
most colleges and universities have 
plunged headlong into creating classrooms and curriculum where critical thinking is supported, promoted and rewarded. however, the more challenging but powerful methods of critical dialogue that allow us to courageously confront the ways we have been trained to distance ourselves from difference are often overlooked. facilitated critical dialogue leads participants to understand the power of introspection, perspective-taking and the importance of examining hidden biases. creating a culture of dialogue on college campuses strengthens both marginalized and privileged groups in their capacity to build common ground rooted in an ethos of care aimed at dismantling oppression.wc009. supporting our sisters, not

 ■kate harrington-rosen, praxis group  
this interactive, skill-building workshop 
encourages participants to critically examine the ways that women’s centers have historically marginalized or struggled to serve transgender and gender non-conforming (tgnc) people, and to develop actionable steps to become more inclusive for people of all marginalized genders. this workshop asks: how have women’s centers been complicit in perpetuating exclusive notions of womanhood? how have women’s centers upheld the gender binary, and in so doing, who have they left out? what practical steps can my center take to create a space that is truly inclusive and affirming for all who experience gender-based violence and discrimination?wc010. about the book: university and

contesting undesirability: black women’s 
perceptions and experiences using mobile dating applications
 ■dominique m adams-santos,  
northwestern universitydiscourses of online dating within 
popular culture and social science research often emphasize black women’s marginality in the ‘online sexual marketplace,’ or the internet-mediated, often hierarchical, market of potential romantic and sexual partners (paul et al. 2010). the present. this paper seeks to trouble this framing by interrogating what we term the undesirability thesis, or the conclusions drawn within popular and social science discourse that render black women undesirable sexual and romantic partners. utilizing focus group and individual in-depth interviews, our study seeks to understand black women’s perceptions and experiences using mobile dating apps.
advertising difference: #takebackstaring 
and the use of social media by an international disability movement
 ■dara persis murray, manhattanville college
this talk focuses on how members of an 
international online disability movement communicate meanings and practices of glam to claim visibility. in celebrating their “crippled, deviant bodies,” c-punks resist internalized ableism and negotiate the bio-politics of gender. based on interviews with c-punks and textual analysis of c-punk community posts, i propose that the use of glam by c-punks is an activist approach for reinterpreting the disabled female body positively. simultaneously, though, c-punk activism communicates neoliberal attitudes of corporeal self-surveillance that raise questions about women’s digital self-representation and activism as well as values emerging from contemporary performances of disability and gender.
theorizing the cyber body: transgender 
embodiment and sexuality online
 ■joel brimmerman, university of cincinnati
i draw on posthuman feminist and 
transgender scholarship in order to challenge the common notion that cybersex is merely a disembodied simulation of “real” sex. instead, i show not only how the body is present online, but also how the cyber body reveals the discursively constructed nature of all bodies. to illustrate my argument, i do close readings of cam shows and user-generated pornography featuring transgender users to demonstrate how the transgender body is constructed online through sexual interaction.
transgender digital embodiment
 ■jessica rae fisher, kennesaw state university
using donna haraway’s “cyborg manifesto” i’m interested in interrogating the way that transgender people embody themselves through digital means, primarily in online spaces. using haraway’s idea of the cyborg being, “… a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction,” (haraway, 149) i will interrogate ideas about online being a less real space then offline, and the way that online spaces allow for transgender individuals to autonomously create realities that they may otherwise not be able to make. i conclude by arguing that online bodies create discomfort for the ways they are  harder to control.

embodied politics: toward a non-singularity 
of being
 ■annie felix, new york university
judith butler writes of the body at stake 
as politically potent, that politics is necessarily a state of being embodied and at-stake (notes toward a performative theory of assembly).  the question, then, is not the politics of the body so much as the body as politics. as such, this paper concentrates on questions of what the body is and what such an embodied politics may be. i attempt here at a body beyond its traditional constructions/boundaries – a body that is not just discursively produced, but also necessarily material, and affect-producing – that anticipates a non-singularity of being that is at-stake and political.61
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: thursday, november 8the pitch perfect movie franchise  
and tumblr’s queer reverb
 ■angel lemke, union institute & university
tumblr users describe embodied 
experience of the platform as “immersive”, a “plenitude,” a “collective excess.” using cho’s notion of tumblr’s “queer reverb,” i examine the pitch perfect fandom’s “nonlinear, atemporal rhizomal exchange of affect and sensation” (47). fans resist heteronormative media through “return, recirculation, and transformative reworking” (stein 87) to express longing for explicit recognition of queer desire in non-canonical same-sex ships and pleasure in subtextual queerness. pp fans enact “a new affective mode of cultural conversation, one that rejects heteronorms...and the boundaries between public and private” (stein 96) and thus provide a reprieve from the emotional strain of heteronormativity.
laws upon the body of those labeled addict
 ■lynn madden, apt foundation, inc.
this paper explores the ways that culture produces the person labeled as “drug addict” through society’s reliance on juridical systems of power. persons labeled as addicts are, by definition, criminals and “deviants” who it is deemed necessary to control for the safety of others. control is accomplished by denying individual agency and through bodily control through the construction of systems of care and with the support of dominant racialized and gendered systems of prisons and healthcare.
(de)institionalized bodies: a critique  
of the university
 ■noa ryan, new york university
looking at the anglo-american higher 
education system as a racialized (read:white/colonial) means of intertwined knowledge and wealth production interested in docile and “working” bodies and individuals (foucault) in the neoliberal era, this project will critique institutions of higher education in america. the second half of the paper will focus on salvaging from this framework the radical potentialities nested in the modern university, using moten and harney’s undercommons: fugitive planning and black study. in particular i will focus on how study might serve as a flashpoint for rethinking the individualizing/disembodied aims  
of the university.
broadening (in)animacy: body, flesh,  
and matter
 ■rachel menard, new york university
if power and ideology are inscribed on the body, what does being no-body allow? i would like to consider the theoretical and political possibility that lies in a blurring of what is usually considered animate/inanimate — the breakdown of the body into ‘flesh’ or the assumption of it as ‘object’ or ‘matter’. i will work with hortense spillers, fred moten, and alexander g. weheliye, along with new materialists like jane bennett, to ask: what alternative relationships do each provide? and, importantly, how does flesh relate to matter?”

demand the impossible: race, class, 
sexualities on the 1972 (shirley)  
chisholm trail
 ■barbara winslow, brooklyn college
this paper discusses the racialized 
misogyny facing shirley chisholm during her 1972 campaign for the democratic presidential nomination. chisholm was the first african american and the first woman to seek the nomination. throughout her career as an elected official, first in state legislature and then in congress, she was ignored, mocked, and slandered, not only by whites, but also by some african americans, mainly men, who unfortunately internalized racist misogyny. yet, chisholm refused to be silenced and continued to fight for her intersectional vision of social justice, from which we can draw much inspiration for our own political imaginings today.

u.s.-mexico border tropes have long 
held a close relationship with racialized nationalisms, having become increasingly salient in popular discourse in recent years and often accommodating hyper anglo masculinity as a resource to combat perceived social ills. this paper examines how select border tropes and anti-mexican stereotypes used by donald trump during his 2016 presidential campaign create the specter of a vulnerable united states threatened 62

a renaissance of feminist ritual: susan b. 
anthony’s gravesite on election day
 ■christine anne kray, rochester institute  
of technology
in ritual, participants “rehearse their 
future” (driver, 1991). rituals symbolically communicate values, and through their performance, participants embody those values, transforming themselves in the process. prior to 2016, in a small-scale “sticker ritual,” voters in rochester, ny placed their “i voted” stickers on susan b. anthony’s gravestone. on election day 2016, about 10,000 participated. interviews revealed that this action personified a groundswell of feminist will, at a time when the country appeared about to elect its first female president and to defeat her sexist and misogynist opponent. what are the possibilities (and pitfalls) of ritual in the new  
women’s movement?
fashioning feminist protest: the pussyhat  
and the promise of political imagination
 ■einav rabinovitch-fox, case western reserve

the paper examines the political 
meaning of the pussyhat as a fashionable feminist icon, and its role in popularizing feminism in the public imagination since the last presidential election. situating the pussyhat in a long history of feminism’s relationship with fashion, the paper considers the imaginative and material role of fashion statements in political campaigns such as the struggle for suffrage, as a way to rethink the role of fashion in shaping feminist protests, past and future. i argue that fashion became crucial to efforts in expanding freedom and advancing feminist agendas, serving as a realm of pleasure, empowerment, and resistance011. art moves: from text to action

on non-reproducing women: atwood’s the 
handmaid’s tale and the failure of coalition politics in performance
 ■krista k. miranda, northeastern university
in 2017 , women wearing red robes 
and white bonnets occupied state capitals across the u.s, mobilizing margaret atwood’s figure of the “handmaid” from her book/television series the handmaid’s tale in a series of reproductive justice protests. atwood’s dystopia—where “barren” women (depicted as villainous or pathetic) oppress sympathetic reproducing handmaids—illustrates the fragmentation that current discourses and performances around reproductive justice engender. from a queer, crip, feminist perspective, this presentation challenges white-cis-centered expressions of biological determinism that pit reproducing women against non-reproducing women to imagine intersectional performances of collective resistance against the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy emboldened under trump’s regime.

archival aesthetics
 ■victor bene, pitzer college
this paper will argue towards a

in localized  black trans femme’s bodily archive of house/ball culture. thus i analyze three art pieces that center black trans femme cultural production: reina gosset’s atlantic is a sea of bones, elijah dixon’s blackberry, and micah bizant’s #translifeandliberation rendering of micky bradford’s resistance to hb2.   for examples, i will reexamines e. patrick johnson’s notion of gesture in forefronting ancestral calling and resistance enacted by voguing (johnson 201 1).

each scholar-educator provides insights into challenges and possibilities of implementing marronage pedagogies.  specifically we reflect on lessons learned through the arts based hip-hop feminist practice of saving our lives hear our truths (solhot) and our critical engagements with performance pedagogy in staging with students and peers critical imaginings of ourselves and the future (brown 2009; 2013).

as we envision feminist futures of 
liberation and accessibility, digital media and cyberspace has been an avenue for dismantling rigid hierarchies and boundaries. online media platforms have been used as tools to nurture community-university relationships. the goal of this workshop is to demonstrate how creating feminist online content reclaims our truths and visions of liberation. participants will learn to design shareable content, i.e. videos, podcasts, zines, and other mediums using accessible tools to creatively resist in community. we hope this workshop will elaborate how muxerista pedagogy and queer intersectional activism can manifest in cybercommunities that value self-care and healing.

palestinian plasticity in israel/palestine’s 
cross-border labor economy
 ■elizabeth bentley, university of arizona
this presentation examines artwork  
by palestinian photographer and  
mixed-media artist samira badran that envisions the palestinian body as unnatural and inhuman techno-assemblage. i argue that badran’s imagery highlights the fragility of the palestinian economy and the precariousness of palestinian life (butler 2004). simultaneously however, badran’s rhetorical recycling of artificial and unnatural belonging suggests an alternative means of relating to and inhabiting the land, one that ruptures backwards-oriented eco-national teleologies to envisions queerer forms of (co)existence and intimacy for these dark times (morton 2007 , p.195).
abject intimacies
 ■alejandra i. ramirez, university of arizonathis paper looks at gestures of abject intimacies through an analysis of three border murals depicting male israeli, russian, and us politicians’ public displays of sensual affections. border muralists critique state-sanctioned policing of who can be sensual and sexual, how, and for what purpose. i analyze and interpret the murals through josé esteban muñoz’s cruising utopia, jasbir puar’s terrorist assemblages and describe how murals and muralists bear witness to and confront state controlled intimacy, proximity and sexuality.
making visible the invisible: missing

the purpose of this paper is to offer a 
grounded theory qualitative analysis based on in-depth interviews with single black women (mothers and grandmothers) who are navigating autism services within the constraints of state-based health insurance and limited resources (n=30). drawing on the analytic framework of intersectionality developed by black feminist scholars, this paper examines alternative ways of knowing autism and the impact of intersectional inequities on families of children with autism that have been silent in the discourses of autism disparities.

whose disability? rethinking disability  
and disablement in the iranian and kurdish women war survivors
 ■sona kazemi, university of toronto
this article is a gender analysis of a 
case study, which studied war and the resulting production of disabled bodies in iranian kurdistan. through the case study, i studied the processes and relations of disablement (kazemi, 2017) in the kurdish and iranian survivors of the iran-iraq war, in which chemical weapons of mass destruction were used. as a woman war survivor, i approach the process of ‘creation of a disablement due to violence’ not as a biomedical issue, rather as a politically- and socially-organized condition (erevelles, 201 1; gorman, 2005, 2016) that is inevitably gendered, raced, and classed.

the future?

 ■an sasala, the university of kansas
this paper provides a reading of maeve 
(westworld, hbo) as offering a re-theorizing of human identities in relation to the “body” and “flesh”—a materially non-human positionality, subjectivity, and agency. maeve problematizes “body” and “flesh” as theorized by hortense spillers (the captured body/ungendered flesh), l.h. stallings (illusive flesh), and sylvia wynter (underlife in the colonial planation). i use trans theory to address gender expression and resistance to colonial norms within the westworld theme park which i theorize as a technological plantation.  
maeve challenges socio-cultural conventions and creates the “underlife” which allows for her own freedom and park-wide revolution.
trigger happy: venus selenite’s black  
trans feminism
 ■marquis bey, cornell university
poet and writer venus selenite, a black 
trans woman whose revolt is taken up, in part, via her “walk[ing] out of the rectangles,” poetically inscribes the onset of a black trans feminist revolutionary project. selenite conveys a black trans feminism through meditations on her mother’s deafness and life in economic penury, her zora neale hurston-infused paraontology that skin ain’t always kin, and “defying false tongues from your / parents on gender, ” culminating in a “feminism we couldn’t learn from college.” through selenite, the revolution is a triggering interruption, unincorporable and, in a word (or three), black, trans, and feminist.
revolutionary atmospheres? affective trans* 
politics in the global north65
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: thursday, november 8 ■yv e. nay, london school of economics  
and political science
the achievements of global north/
west transgender politics have occurred through neoliberal notions of equality. as trans* activists and scholars aptly caution, such politics perpetuates colonial violence. with a focus on discomfort, this paper explores ways to decolonise transnational transgender politics in the global north and west. it argues that such an approach might open up ways to consider trans* politics as an imaginary that would enable fragmented realities, bodies and selves to become legible and articulable, making it possible to name the violence that is at work in politics under the purview of transgender/trans*.

for black scholars to “become undisciplined”, this roundtable focuses on the unique positionality and potential that black graduate students have within the academy. our overarching focus is the project of becoming undisciplined as black queer/trans/women graduate students, and exploring ways to refuse legibility, pursue decolonial and liberatory knowledge production, and commit to affirming black life and pleasure within and outside of higher education. some of the themes central to this roundtable are: creating (non) academic home places; avoiding the sunken place in academia; canons, citational politics, and alternative intellectual genealogies; and pleasure and possibility.

a phenomenological defense of  
sexual pharmakotherapy
 ■caitlin leach, towson university
the pharmaceuticalization of women’s 
sexuality is not inherently problematic. rather, it is a biochemical attempt to change the relations among bodies, worlds, and desires. admittedly, pharmaceutical approaches to women’s sexuality have typically been reductionist, but a feminist phenomenological deployment of pharmaceutical data need not proceed this way. utilizing sociological studies of women’s experiences of their sexuality and the pharmacokinetic data of flibanserin and prasterone, this paper lays the groundwork for a pharmakological phenomenology that recognizes the ambiguous biochemical changes induced by pharmaceuticals have as much import for our lived experiences as our external world.
apocalypse, now!: surviving the 
pharmacopornographic era by imagining queer futures in michelle tea’s black wave
 ■leah elizabeth wilson, washington  
state university
this presentation explores michelle 
tea’s latest memoir-novel, black wave (2016), in which tea provides an account of her life in 1999 as she leaves her sex radical san francisco community for los angeles just before the apocalypse. fictionalizing her life-narrative in an apocalyptic novel, tea reflects current concerns of the globalizing, hyper-capitalist “pharmacopornographic era” and purposefully mixes genres to prepare readers for other ways of being human, effectively crafting a message of resistance and survival. offering two versions of the self, tea emphasizes queer possibilities for imagining more equitable communities and futures.
hacking the body (politic): trans/feminist 
strategies for post-biopolitical futures
 ■alex barksdale, university of arizona
this paper puts biotechnology 
(including bio-art), “xenofeminism”, and transfeminismo (spanish and latin american transfeminism) in the same frame to look at how various trans*, transfeminist, and gender abolitionist social movements engage in practices that stage the body as a site of political transformation through the means of technology. i trace their various genealogies, critically assess their strategies for resisting biopolitics, and highlight their radical visions of new embodiments and social relations.
the biopolitics of women’s sport: contesting 
categories and imagining a feminist future
 ■valerie anne moyer, stony brook university
this paper addresses recent statements

groups on facebook
 ■nada mustafa ali, university of massachusetts 
boston
based on digital ethnographic research, 
this paper engages the conversations on sudanese women’s facebook groups critically. online discussions often cover issues of body beautification, traditional aesthetic rituals, and sexuality. increasingly, members of some groups prioritize self-acceptance and self-care. they discuss and challenge gender-based violence, gender inequality, and other, intersecting forms of marginalization. i ask whether, in a context marked by militarization, neoliberal globalization, and the constant scrutinizing of women’s bodies, such platforms and the internet reinforce existing inequalities; offer liberating spaces where women can dream of and work toward transformation, or both.
“feminized” men? prison sexual violence  
in malawi
 ■ashley currier, university of cincinnati
media accounts of sexual violence in malawian prisons housing men portray victims as “feminized,” focusing on the pliability of boys’ and men’s bodies in acts of rape.  i use analyses of malawian newspaper accounts and human rights reports that document sexual violence in prisons to suggest that the dominant feminization paradigm is inadequate because it perpetuates a binary understanding of masculinity and femininity. using work by oyèrónké oyĕwùmí and eve kosofsky sedgwick, i theorize an orthogonal approach to prison sexual violence that decenters a binary understanding of gender in favor of a situated model of intersectional power dynamics.
“the ugly history of this country lives in me”: 
the wounded female body as archive
 ■selina makana, columbia university
how can we read women’s accounts 
of their wounded bodies and hidden memories of their wartime experiences as cautionary gestures for us to be aware of the glorious renderings of modern nationalisms in africa?  i argue that from 1975-2002, the post-independent state and non-state insurgent groups in angola targeted women’s bodies as a form of biopolitical control. this paper returns to the debilitated female body to examine how ‘wounding’ narratives of survivors offer an alternative way of rewriting the history of modern angola.

narrating love and violence: women 
contesting caste, tribe, and state in lahaul, india is the first ethnographic exploration of women’s stories from the himalayan valley of lahaul, in the region of himachal pradesh, india. the book focuses on how both love and violence emerge and function at the intersection of gender, tribe, caste, and the state in india. bhattacharya privileges the everyday lives of women marginalized by caste and tribe to show how state and community discourses about gendered violence serve as proxy for caste in india, thus not only upholding these social hierarchies, but also enabling violence. bhattacharya centers lahauli women’s narratives as a site of knowledge demonstrating how women on the margins of tribe and caste know both, love and violence, as agents wishing to re-shape discourses of caste, tribe and community.

exclusionary behavior in field work: power 
dynamics & barriers to entry
 ■dorian g russell, the association  
for women in science
accessing scientific fields like 
conservation, geology, and ecology often includes working and living in close quarters with supervisors in remote, physically challenging environments. when internet connection, cellular service, and bystanding witnesses are not available, problems arise in reporting harassment, accessing safety, and continuing critical scientific work. risks in reporting are high; field work opportunities are fiercely competitive, unpaid, and often require financial investment from early-career researchers. this paper explores structural gaps in reporting systems, identifies pivotal career stages where barriers to entry and exclusion occur, and suggests policy and cultural change strategies from the perspective of a rainforest ecologist herself.

exclusionary behavior in virtual communities: 
a negative feedback loop for inclusivity
 ■aspen russell, the association for women 
in science
virtual environments serve as afoundation 
for identity creation in many stem fields. by excluding certain groups, stereotype creation and stereotype threat compound leading to disparity. when facing an environment that is rife with outdated or non-existent laws, rarely enforced platform rules, and user anonymity, few harassers face any repercussions. lack of enforcement leads to serious consequences through doxxing (non-consensual public release of information), dogpiling (targeted online group attacks), and other forms of digital harassment. this paper explores the various harassment methods, industry response, and suggestions for adaptations to reporting mechanisms in hopes of imagining  
just virtual environments.

this paper uses black women’s recent 
organizing around natural hair to analyze their contributions to race,  class, and gender change. using qualitative methods, including 80 semi-structured interviews with african-descended women across four continents and three years of participant observation at natural hair events and in online networks, i examine the implications of black women’s shifting body practices on their political praxis and purchasing patterns. i demonstrate how black women’s collaborative critique, entrepreneurship, cultural production and embodied transformations through the natural hair movement disrupt the racialized gender order within and over against the confines of the present commercialized neoliberal era.
“transform your hair!”: black femininity,

 ■kristin denise rowe, michigan state university
the late 2000s opened space for 
many black women to stop chemically straightening their hair and wear their hair natural--resulting in the “natural hair movement” (“nhm”). i investigate internet based representations within this movement as spaces where beauty standards are contested, reified, revealed, and reshaped. the subjects include: 1) two natural haircare brands 2) popular website curlynikki.com and 3) the work of a popular video blogger.  i argue the nhm is a space where negotiations of black femininity, beauty, and identity occur, where we find intimacies, (re)negotiations, and (re)articulations of both “beauty work” and black women’s embodimen

stand-up comedy as transformative space 
for raced and gendered resistance
 ■laura-ann jacobs, university of michiganthis paper examines stand-up  
comedy as a form of performance  that empowers individuals to feature their own raced and gendered  identities and to call for social change.  stand-up comedy is a form of counter-storytelling performance because comedians confront the metanarratives that eclipse their own unique personal identities and experiences and share their stories for themselves. professional comedians use their stand-up comedy sets as spaces to perform their own personal stories, to choose how to represent themselves and their communities, and to openly challenge systems of oppression. this paper focuses on how professional comedians perform their identities to challenging dominant discourse.
spoken word as a medium for feminist 
resistance to xenophobia in u.s. schooling
 ■carolyn hetrick, university of michigan
the author examines spoken word 
performances as articulations of feminist resistance to institutionalized xenophobia in u.s. schooling. using cultural studies and critical race theory lenses, the author considers specific performances as counterstories to the dominant patriarchal, white supremacist education system. these counterstories include themes of re-storying identity and disturbing majoritarian assumptions and ideals in school curricula and social environments. the author explores how these counterstories point toward spoken word performance as an exercise in liberatory feminist epistemologies and discusses how these epistemologies may play a role in decolonizing u.s. schooling.

invisibility, fuckability, or queerability?: a 
feminist investigation of gender exploration & identity in adolescent girls ■keeley gogul, university of cincinnati
in her 2015 tedtalk, gail dines 
suggests that adolescent girls have two choices when faced with assimilating the contemporary images of women that surround them into their own gender identity: invisibility or fuckability. this paper explores the effect of the images that saturate our culture on adolescent women. focusing on the tension between the hypergenderized/hypersexualized images in the media and adolescent girls’ quest for a place to fit in to this narrative, this paper explores the concept that girls embody gender fluidly and engages the theory that some choose queerability as a form of resistance to the hypersexualized, gender-normative dialogue.
producing radical narratives: queer of color 
children’s literature as praxis
 ■isabel millan, university of oregon
“a child should not long for their own 
image,” proclaims queer chicana author and illustrator maya christina gonzalez (2017). while most lgbtq-themed children’s picture books limit same sex desire to adults (abate and kidd 201 1; mickenberg and nel 2008), this paper privileges children’s picture books with queer of color characters. from gender-neutral or transgender characters in gonzalez’s picture books to my own queer of color characters, i will reflect on the process of creating, writing, and illustrating for children.  
i argue that contemporary queer of color children’s literature disrupts colonial heteropatriarchy and western notions of what i theorize as “childnormativity.”
questioning the humanizing trend in 
education: queer and transgender youth of color who relish in the fractured and fluid
 ■bess van asselt, university of  
wisconsin, madison
this paper explores how the life histories 
of three queer and transgender youth of color force educators to question the concept of humanization as it has been embraced in k-12 school contexts. by relishing in angst and being fractured and fluid, these life histories reject humanism and imagine a future where being is relational and transcendent yet tied to the physical body. their histories push educators to centralize a pedagogy that embraces rage, desire and pleasure in lieu of creating human subjects.

adolescent sexual health in the us south
 ■gwendolyn ferreti, the university of alabama 
latinas in the us south are coming of 
age and debuting their sexual lives as new migrants in a region that does not account for their existence. an institutional vacuum of sexual health education/healthcare and an increasing reduction of available services, greater restrictions on women’s sexual/reproductive choices, and racialized xenophobia targeting growing latino immigrant populations greatly complicates the lived experiences of adolescent latinas. this paper questions the institutional disinvestment in latina adolescent life and explores latinas concerns for their sexual futures in alabama. we further interrogate how the denial of migrants’ sexual health  
 and rights dehumanizes migrants.

the future of disciplines are reliant 
upon social justice praxis pedagogies as incorporated by activists turned academics. through transforming the academic spaces, with activism, educators have the ability to empower students not available in the past.  
in the absence of consistent leadership education, mentoring and leadership development, many young women  
of color are not provided with experiences in order to create  
liberatory educational opportunities.
intentionally empowered youth classrooms
 ■lisa d. covington, the university of iowa
strategies are needed in order to create spaces for young people of color to feel empowered within the classroom. as cultural workers and advocates create spaces within universities and k-12 classrooms, we have the ability to affirm the experiences of marginalized students and recognize students’ identities in order to create space for their empowerment. in creating spaces of empowerment and liberation, pedagogical tools must include student input. conversations rooted in arming students with culturally relevant curriculum, critical thinking skills and developing intentional spaces for growth, students begin to see themselves as agents of change.

literary play and women’s organizing practices create political and pedagogical agency through theater. ■erika ramirez mayoral, university of

the construction of the rural is a complex 
relationship of developmental processes in which women are key protagonists. this paper aims to look at how the rural is transformed into a site of politics where i employ the use of pedagogical community theater and established playwrights to reflect on how women are leading political moments in rural sites. this paper discusses the role of theater as a pedagogical community tool that can be used to examine where politics occurs while also considering how women are changing the spaces in which they are engaged when creating and participating in political acts.

cheryl clarke and the profundity of the 
black lesbian body
 ■briona s. jones, michigan state university
cheryl clarke postulates in 1981 that, 
“the lesbian has decolonized her body.” this paper explores the connection between black lesbian epistemologies and decolonial thought. drawing on theories from m. jacqui alexander, hortense spillers, and audre lorde, i argue that cheryl clarke’s early conception of decolonization elucidates how black lesbians, specifically, employ a corporeal resistance through the reclamation of their sexuality and bodies. through an explication of cheryl clarke’s poem, “marimba” and prose piece, “lesbianism: an act of resistance,” this paper demonstrates how lesbian love can transgress scenes of subjection and the colonial project, thus forging space for alternative futurities.
alternative landscapes and radical futurities: 
imagined geographies in edwidge danticat’s claire of the sea light
 ■rebecca louise fussell, michigan  
state university
this paper considers katherine 
mckittrick’s use of demonic grounds to engage imagined geographies in black women’s literatures. similarly, marisa parham and dionne brand also present methodologies that draw attention to and unhinge geography from its colonial implications. here, i read edwidge danticat’s claire of the sea light for its use of imagined landscapes that not only reenvision traditional notions of geography, but also gender and liberal notions of agency. i argue that claire calls for a consideration of the ethics involved in thinking futurity, especially  as thinking new/future forms of humanity is often bound to celebrated forms  of resistance.
funk the future: kuso and the black sexual

 ■cameron clark, vanderbilt university
this paper examines flying lotus’s 
film kuso for how it deploys a sexual politics of disgust to imagine black queer futurities. following aliyyah abdur-rahman, jennifer nash, darieck scott, and l.h. stallings, i read black anality as a representational device for navigating race, gender, and sexuality as coconstitutive categories of being and belonging. pairing together black anality with the film’s spatialization of environmental catastrophe, kuso inverts that which is often considered filthy, abject, or toxic as generative. that is, through disgust, kuso produces a queer afrofuturist project of corporeal unraveling and subsequent communal recovery that rethinks sexual freedom from within crisis.

in the mix: some interfaith and multicultural 
roots of jewish feminism, 1970-2000
 ■tamara fish, the jewish multiracial network
jewish feminism is a strange term.  
on the one hand, does “jewish 
feminism” simply refer to feminists who happen to be jewish? on the other hand, to what extent is judaism, as a religion,  
a factor in jewish feminism? this paper explores the emergence of jewish feminism from with the context of the academic study of religion; the cohort of women of different faith traditions and ethnicities in conversation with each other who struggled to reclaim women’s voices, women’s bodies, and women’s religion; the fruitful and sometimes contentious discussions among jewish feminist theologians and womanist (african-american christian liberationist) theologians; and the resulting emergent jewish feminist theologies that have already had a lasting impact on  
judaism today.
engaging the white fire: jewish feminist 
approaches to biblical text
 ■sabrina sojourner, sabrina sojourner, tlsc
the talmud tells us that the torah given to 
moses was “black fire written upon white fire, sealed by fire...” to engage the white fire is to enter the space between the words, the letters to find deeper meaning for ourselves and others. traditional text analysis has informed jewish feminist engagement with biblical text. yet, some key challenges disappointingly stayed within the confines previously laid down by the rabbis. this presentation will examine key misses in traditional jewish feminist analysis of traditional text.
women of valor: change from the kitchen
 ■shekhiynah larks, b’chol lashon, sfhillel
a woman of valor is a poem written in proverbs chapter 31[3]; it is tradition in some jewish households for the partner of the woman of the house to read or sing the poem before the start of shabbat. the purpose of this poem is to praise the woman of the house for her hard work that week, and the previous weeks; to remind the woman of the house that the table she has created is the starting place for olam haba. although it has become taboo to make commentary on women in the kitchen, one must be clear that the issue was never the kitchen, it was the fallacy that women could not change the world from the kitchen. in this way, it becomes necessary to change the interpretation of the tradition for any intrinsic value to be found in it due to the current interpretation perpetuated by the dominant culture.  the preparation of the shabbat table reminds us that women play a large role in creating spaces for others to produce change.jewish lesbian feminism: contexts  
and consequences
 ■evelyn torton beck, university of maryland
jewish lesbian feminism was an 
important and visible force in the early years of lesbian feminist organizing.  many jewish lesbians were very active in the gay liberation movement, but remained invisible as jews, while they were equally invisible as lesbians in jewish communities. nice jewish girls: a lesbian anthology (1982) brought together diverse jewish lesbian voices that broke this invisibility and became  a catalyst for further activism.  as editor  of this anthology, and founding member  of nwsa’s jewish and lesbian caucuses, i will discuss the history of this movement and its meaning for today.

properties worth resisting: compulsory 
homeownership and disrupting state  
economic violence
 ■nicholas belongie, university at buffalo
new modes of creating “home” are 
under fire. police, ordinances, and architectural forms operationalize racial capitalism and compromise survival for those in the fissures of systems that define human value through patriarchy, white supremacy, and unfettered access to capital. nomadic van-living, tiny homes, and homelessness fall inside the hierarchies of capitalism but create methods of side-stepping old models of and a focus on ownership. by mapping how cities create policy to thwart alternate definitions of “home” and  
non-ownership, we can re-frame resistance to capital, shifting away from paradigms of property to possibilities  
for radical collectivities.
epistemological congruence, artificial divisions: 
economic politicking against blackness and muslims
 ■melinda quinn brennan, suny oneonta
white supremacy undergirds increasing 
attacks against racialized others, with influxes of capital mobilized against “black identity extremists” and “banning” muslims from the us. the epistemological congruencies across forms of interrelated bigotry, essentialized constructions of groups cohered through threat to white supremacist patriarchal nationalism, are not only a ‘scene of solidarity’ between economically violent actors, but reveal the violent intimacies of capital. this paper investigates the normalization of white nationalism, which exists not only through the powers of the state, but is upheld primarily through racist and religious bigotry fueled and funded by right wing commentators and lobbyists.

college park
after the tragedy of september 1 1, 
2001, glenda dickerson developed a performance trilogy entitled the kitchen prayer series. with this trilogy, dickerson interrogates how women, from across the globe, navigate a world where war and terror are quotidian experiences. this paper illustrates that while reviving the life and words of these global women, dickerson’s dramaturgy travels between the local and international, creating sites of transformation and transference through a transnational feminist praxis through performance. by privileging women’s voices worldwide, dickerson creates the possibility for a global  
feminist future among women invested  
in forging dialogues across cultural and  
political boundaries.

analogy as symptom: trans and decolonial 
perspectives on the genres of the human
 ■marie draz, san diego state university
this paper counters the temptation 
to produce “like-race” arguments in theorizing gender, particularly as witnessed in recent analogical approaches to trans identity, through a turn to what sylvia wynter has called the genre of man. by theorizing the stubborn analogical instinct as a symptom of a failure to fully engage with decolonial insights on the human, i argue in particular that frantz fanon’s account of the human offers ways of thinking biological sex as racializing that do not either collapse or reductively compare categories of race and gender.
cure logic: trans experience, anxiety,  
and profit
 ■hilary malatino, penn state university
this paper explores how contemporary biomedical practice frames medical transition as curative and, by extension, a means of ameliorating the complex of negative affects (primarily manifesting as anxiety and depression) that are often associated with trans experience. connecting the affective promises of trans-related medical practice with questions of debt, poverty, medical profit, and the structural vulnerability of trans subjects - particularly those who are femme, poor, queer, non-stealth, and of color - this paper frames such promises as structured by a form of cruel optimism that elides questions of economically stratified medical access, biomedical  
cis-normativity, and trans iatrophobia (fear of medical professionals).
techno-biopolitics and embodiment: theorizing

android from dark matter as trans*, i analyze the body of the android through an intersectional lens. i delve into gender, race, and david huebert’s ‘species panic’ arguing that the triply other-ed transgender android would inspire a triple panic with direct ramifications for trans* bodies, especially trans women of color. i address biopolitical ordering of life via the “gaze.” i use susan stryker’s “passing” and micha cárdenas’s shift to discuss sexual encounters as creating both the potential for/panic of transgender otherness. this panic impacts trans women of color/transgender androids through a reliance on sex  
work narratives.

women’s and gender studies as a field is meant to be a transformative force within the academy. however, wgs departments function under the dictates of the neoliberal university, which relies on the labor of graduate students and adjunct faculty. based on the efforts advanced by graduate students to organize workers within their wgs department and university, this roundtable imagines alternative ways to talk about graduate student labor. we will imagine a politics of refusal, think through labor politics in progressive neoliberal departments, dispel the myth of the “graduate student” non-worker, and discuss feminist pedagogy in relation to activist teaching.

040. amc: embodied reckonings: 
“comfort women,” performance,  
and transpacific redress
4:00pm - 5:15pm
room 209-211embodied reckonings examines 
the political and cultural aspects of contemporary performances that have grappled with the history of the “comfort women,” the japanese military’s euphemism for the sexual enslavement of girls and young women—mostly korean—in the years before and during world war ii. long silent, in the early 1990s these women and their supporters initiated varied performance practices—protests, tribunals, theater, and memorial-building projects—to demand justice for those affected by state-sponsored acts  
of violence.
based on extensive archival and 
ethnographic research, the study argues for the central role of performance in how korean survivors, activists, and artists have redressed the histories—and erasures—of this sexual violence. merging cultural studies and performance theory with a transnational, feminist analysis, the book illuminates the actions of ordinary people, thus offering ways of reconceptualizing legal and political understandings of redress that tend to concentrate on institutionalized forms of state-based remediation

academy does not serve as a viable space for teaching, speaking/writing against white supremacy. instead it serves as a space for public and political scrutiny and backlashes.  these backlashes can be read as attempts to quell leftist ideology on college campuses, attacks on tenur/academic freedom, and used as a dog whistle of the free speech movement. drawing from the personal experiences this panel will use backlashes against critiques of white supremacy as an analytical apparatus for connecting histories of u.s. racial violence to the current state of white 
backlash on minoritized subjects.

weaponizing white womanhood in the alt-
right campus takeover
 ■amanda gailey, university of  
nebraska, lincoln
the paper will discuss how white 
womanhood occupies a special place in attempts to quell leftist thinking and teaching on college campuses. rightwing organizations are specifically recruiting white college women in order to advance regressive economic and social arguments while taking advantage of progressive arguments for the amplification and protection of women’s voices. these organizations simultaneously appeal to traditional racist, patriarchal beliefs and progressive feminist beliefs about protecting young (white) women, and offer recruits a sense of empowerment that resembles mainstream feminism while employing it in the service of fundamentally racist and economically oppressive policy positions.

supremacy? institutional racism, right wing backlash and academic freedom
 ■reshmi dutt-ballerstadt, linfield college
this paper will frame the politics of 
backlash that scholars of color have been subjected to against the kinds of institutional responses that have either provoked further backlashes,or have mitigated them. the author herself who was a subject of such attacks will focus on the relationship between academic freedom and the (in)equality of free speech, and how these “protections and rights” are compromised when institutions fall prey to the various outside political pressures. some safeguards will be offered to combat this “chilly climate” while drawing attention to the massive political machine that are making  attempt to dismantle such safeguards.

beyond visuality and surveillant 
epistemologies: visions of black/white interracial desire
 ■jocelyn coates, university of maryland, 
college park
many queer studies and women’s 
studies scholars, such as siobhan somerville (2000), have thoroughly explored how black/white interracial subjects are rendered pathological and perverse under u.s. biopolitical regimes. this characterization depends, at least partially, on an obsession with visuality, situating black/white interraciality as hyper-visible and as visually knowable (fleetwood 201 1). accordingly, this project works to unsettle dominant conceptions of black/white interraciality, governed by racializing surveillance (browne 2015), through examining cultural production and employing affective methodologies. how might attuning ourselves to the sensory dimensions of black/white interraciality outside of visuality allow us to better theorize liberatory visions of interracial desire?
probable lives & temporalities: the politics 
of trans/feminine performance aesthetics from below
 ■shehram mokhtar, university of oregon
this paper examines the politics of 
women and trans dance performers and social media stars in pakistan who function outside of the upper/middle class mediated cultures and normative morality. these performers negotiate their low social status, lack of cultural capital, and gender subordination and/or variance with their dance performances, sartorial practices, and sex appeal. dismissed, disregarded, and disparaged within the dominant culture, they cultivate and embody their transgressive gender and performance aesthetics to gain visibility that makes their lives and livelihoods probable. however, the probability of sustenance of life and lifeworlds remains precarious by virtue of the same visibility.
(re)work this pussy: reflections on voguing,

drawing on the work of hortense

la vía campesina: a structural and behavioral

 ■kenna denae neitch, texas tech university
nominally, la vía campesina (lvc), 
the international peasant’s movement is not a women’s movement, but their consistent action against gender oppression while advocating for  social and environmental justice should qualify lvc as a transnational feminist collective. i argue that lvc avoids the five practices feminist theorists have identified as damaging to many international women’s movements: euroamerican domination, center/periphery understandings of global dynamics, erasure of race, acceptance of capitalist values, and global commodification of feminism and  loss of contextual awareness. lvc’s practices should be examined by feminist scholars and activists to identify and potentially replicate agency-affirming strategies and non-hierarchical transnational collaboration.
mothering, activism, and environmental 
justice: building just futures ■reena shadaan, york university
scholarship on women’s environmental 
justice activism often points to a maternal impetus. some scholars critique the maternal frame as essentialist and conservative. however, these critiques rest upon several assumptions – that all women are encouraged to mother, that the essentialist claim of a “natural” ability to care is applied to all mothers, and that mothering is apolitical. using a reproductive justice lens, i argue that maternal activism is neither essentialist, nor conservative. rather, it is resistance labour that challenges the devaluation of indigenous lives, black lives, and the lives of non-black people of colour.
the indigenous erotic as activism
 ■lisa tatonetti, kansas state univeristy
this paper focuses on the indigenous erotic in the literature and hiv activism of two-spirit anishinaabe nurse, woodworker, and writer, carole lafavor (1948-201 1). lafavor’s two detective novels address how queer indigenous people heal from sexual violence while her activism centered the culturally specific needs of hiv-positive indigenous peoples. both index the imbricated nature of tribal identity, health sovereignty, and sexuality.  lafavor overtly situates the indigenous erotic as integral to twentieth-century tribal continuity. this paper would introduce the audience to lafavor’s novels, her embodied activism, and to the extant ties between two-spirit histories, lesbian identities, and indigenous health sovereignty.
tools of resistance: indigenous women and 
community radio in the americas
 ■beth williford, manhattanville college
this paper will explore how the radio 
is used as a tool for decolonization as well as feminist organizing in the americas. women are increasingly more active in community radio throughout the region, from working at stations to producing programs as journalists. community radio has been used for decades by indigenous communities, but traditionally it has been male dominated. thus, it’s critical to understand how indigenous women, doubly marginalized by both ethnicity and gender, are altering the power dynamics, redefining expectations, and energizing indigenous resistance via community radio.

the subjectivity of formlessness: guzmán’s

 ■m.d. murtagh, duke university
this paper thinks chilean filmmaker 
patricio guzmán’s 2015 documentary, el botón de nácar in relation to luce irigaray’s essay, “volume-fluidity.” guzmán’s meditation on stars in outerspace and fluidity of water open a way of thinking subjectivity through formlessness. through the victimization of alacalufe and yaghan indigenous tribes and chilean suffering under pinochet, guzmán speculates, “if water has memory, it will also remember this.” linking water’s capacity for preserving memory to irigaray’s feminine subjectivity beyond the imposition of rigid forms, this paper asks if subjectivity has the capacity to exceed the confines of a cohesive body and instead inhabit shapeless flux.

mermaid maroonage: surviving the 
plantationocene in the new moon’s arms
 ■addie hopes, university of wisconsin-
madison
in nalo hopkinson’s the new moon’s 
arms, “sea people” populate the waters of an imaginary caribbean archipelago. having escaped a sinking slave ship by transforming into monk seals, the “sea people” thrive in aquatic maroon communities as a new “genre of the human,” navigating the “accumulated sediments” of colonial and neo-colonial violence of the plantantionocene . situated at the unlikely intersections of feminist new materialism, black feminist theory, and archipelagic studies, this paper argues that hopkinson’s “mermaid maroons” and the waters they inhabit offer a vision of entangled, multispecies relationality and ever-emergent geography of “oceanic” political resistance.
afrofuturistic visions: rewriting the

“princess steel,” an african indigenous princess with magical steel hair is violently captured and stolen from her homeland. her steel hair, signifying terrestrial resources, is exploited by her colonial overlords and turned into commodity to generate industrial wealth. this paper argues that du bois’ “princess steel,” one of the first touchstones in black science fiction, is a form of a black marxist critique of the origins of modern capitalism and a direct contestation of “race science” that employs afrofuturistic imagination to generate an alternative, anti-colonial political and racial geography of the modern world.045. biopolitics of birth and labor

a good abortion is a tragic abortion: fit 
motherhood and disability stigma
 ■claire mckinney, college of william & mary
the politics of abortion in the united 
states rests on stigma. pro-life politics actively produces stigma while mainstream pro-choice politics endorses privacy that cannot undo public stigma. i argue that abortion stigma conditions public abortion stories. women who qualify as eugenically fit have constructed tragic narratives of a wanted pregnancy disrupted by an impaired fetus. using the historical case of sherri finkbine’s abortion of “thalidomide fetus” and contemporary accounts of abortion in the case of “nonviable” fetuses, i suggest that these abortion narratives mobilize disability stigma to recuperate the moral status of the individual pregnant person as a fit mother.
doulas for the state: intimate labor on the 
margins of welfare
 ■carolyn fraker, university of minnesota
this paper explores a federally funded 
doula initiative, “lean on me,” that provides free birth coaching to low-income pregnant women. the lean on me doulas create room within the overwhelmingly disciplinary welfare state for the physical and emotional experience of pregnancy, acting as advocates for their clients’ right to humane treatment by the state and hospital structures. building on rickie solinger (2005) and dorothy roberts (1997), this paper reveals the complicated ways the state disciplines and controls the bodies of poor women, and how doulas attempt to mitigate these abuses by re-centering a woman’s right to her own bodily integrity.
the bio-politics of pain: assessing

ann fausto-sterling cautions us that biology and culture are not separate; rather they are mutually constitutive, shaping society’s understanding of gender and sexuality. building from and applying fausto-sterling’s theoretical framework to reproductive policy, we examine the intersection of science and culture in fetal pain-based abortion bans, which have been enacted in 17 states. while fetal pain legislation may appear to be a novel approach to restricting abortion, we argue it follows a familiar historical trajectory of reproductive policies that assert and then privilege the humanity of the fetus while simultaneously disappearing the woman from the process of reproductive decision making.
the difference between having and making: 
rethinking how we think and talk about women’s childbirth
 ■jeffrey nall, florida atlantic university
dominant culture in the u.s. fosters 
discourses that render women’s creation of new life, through pregnancy and childbirth, a passive series of events that “happen” to them. many unintentionally implement and maintain these dehumanizing patterns of thought and expression. these disempowering discourses further lend unacknowledged support to anti-abortion arguments that conflate the rights of embryos with the rights of infants; they also support conceptual underpinnings of the “pro-life” worldview premised on the pre-conceived “child” placed in women’s wombs. imagining and implementing more thoughtful ways of thinking and speaking of childbirth may foster healthier understanding of abortion that honors pregnant women.

 ■sayan bhattacharya, university of minnesota
in this paper, i read a play written 
by a group of transwomen in the late 1990s when the hiv-aids scare was at its peak in india.  it invokes the ghost of a transwoman who died of aids. she returns each time a transwoman is about to have unprotected sex to warn her of hiv exposure. i closely follow the ghost and engage with theories of haunting and queer studies to argue that an intimate attachment with death creates a politics of abundance that gestures towards modes of friendship and community making which exceed the grammar of loss and death.

ghost and the hauntology of the slave ship
 ■colin walker wingate, university of minnesota
what happens to black folks who die 
within the hold of a slave ship? thinking through resonances amongst the slave ship, haunting, and chattel slavery, this paper conceptualizes the ghost of the enslaved within the hold  as not simply a remnant of life, but rather black life forced out of the body through acts of subjection. how do these “blackened” ghosts, born of those occupying this zone of social death, come to interact with the living world? what potentialites do these ghosts engender on behalf of their kin still living within the space of anti-blackness, towards living beyond it?
haunting black ontology: thoerizing black 
femmes and (im)possible technologies

 ■naimah zulmadelle petigny, university

existing betwixt states of matter and 
temporalities, the black femme is beholden to no fixed frame of being. her haunting, absent presence--generated through epistemic erasure, disposability and silencing--refuses binary divisions and takes up a multifarious position on death in life. in what ways is haunting a black femme technology that contests the idea that the black body is anchored, solely, in abjection and historical trauma? as this paper works to challenges this ontology, it centers the peripheralized, queer black femme and the unruly, and often overlooked, dimensions of black subjectivity she catalyzes in her embrace of the (im)possible.

björk’s tender erotics - subverting phallic

2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: thursday, november 8 ■stephanie koziej, emory university
this paper focusses on 2music video’s of 
artist björk, pagan poetry and cocoon, and analyzes them as disidentifying performances. through her visual and sonorous artistry, björk simultaneously subverts and rewrites the script of phallic sexuality, carving out a space for a new economy of desire: erotic tenderness. here sexuality, but equally subjectivity and sociality, are not organized according to a phallic binary order. she uses the trope of sperm, to tell a story of intimacy and sexual sociality. in doing so she castrates sperm as the phallic master-signifier of difference, and re-attributes it as a signifier of an alternative sociality.
deviant pathologies: making space for  
queer suicidality
 ■alison elizabeth parks, city university of 
new york
the dominant discourses around suicide 
prevention aimed at vulnerable groups like queer and indigenous youth tend to reproduce a biopolitical imperative to live, which places value on bare life as human capital without alleviating the conditions of subjection/subjectification that make certain lives unlivable. this paper asks whether there is room for resistance within suicidal subjectivity. to theorize this space of resistance located in what i am tentatively calling “casual suicidality” i read foucault’s work on suicide against a contemporary musical on the subject. work in lgbtq historical archives attempts to locate this imagined theoretical space in “real life.”

ungendering me softly: towards a queer 
black trans theory of (self) care
 ■taylor york, university of maryland
“radical softness,” though not that exact 
phrase, has been part of black queer and feminist knowledge production for decades, as well as part of digital and political spaces. using james c. scott’s theories of “hidden transcripts” and “infrapolitics,” hortense spillers’s concept of “ungendering,” and kai green’s idea of “tranifesting”, i explore sonic landscapes and erotic images of black, queer, and trans (self)care. through examining artists’ sonic, visual, and textual renderings, like fka twigs, lizzo, black party, and willow, i argue lora mathis’s term “radical softness” and vulnerability are forms of tranifesting and possibilities within black, trans, queer, and digital spaces.

nationalist “drag” in a “new” india: trans

 ■nishant shahani, washington  
state university
in this paper, i return to a moment of 
political euphoria that followed the aftermath of the indian supreme court’s recognition of “hijras” and transgender people as a third sex in 2014. framed as queer affirmative—even utopian—in scope, i ask how this moment that ostensibly represents “radical political futures” can, in fact, constitute its potential ossification. how can this moment of reified utopia, conceptualized exclusively through state protection and jurisprudence, gesture toward “the work of trans political imaginations” that might not yet exist in the here and now?
drag politics: german homonationalisms and

 ■anson koch-rein, grinnell college
this paper analyzes an example of trans 
activism that emerged in relation to the german federal elections in 2017 called travestie für deutschland (tfd - drag for germany), a photographic art project using a satirical political party campaign to drag the hard-right nationalist party alternative für deutschland (afd - alternative for germany). through the lenses of homonationalism (puar, haritaworn) and transgender citizenship (west), the campaign’s visual and rhetorical embrace of drag politics enters the political field of electoral politics that is fraught with homonationalism and challenges it through a camp articulation of transgender political visibility beyond the role of victim.
the accumulation of dispossession: trans

harvey’s idea of accumulation by

the making of transnational  
feminist imaginations
4:00pm - 5:15pm
room 405
this roundtable will explore translation as 
a feminist practice of imagining planetary justice, solidarity, reconciliation, and co-existence in the face of multiple, intersecting structures of power that violently pit us against each other, particularly along the axes of gender, sexuality, class, race, nationality, and geographic region. by drawing on their diverse experiences and dreams in and of translation, the participants will uncover the politically transformative power of translation, which, when pursued with a decolonial feminist/queer (and geohistorically contingent) ethics of justice, enables transnational feminist imaginations and relationalities that are indispensable to the formation of planetary solidarities, resistances,  
and transgressions.

kid stuff: thinking beyond capitalism’s 
commodification of children
 ■lisa hinrichsen, university of arkansas
this paper examines the figure of the 
child in viability, sarah vap’s 2016 collection of 159 brief prose poems. vap draws upon the child to comment on contemporary bioeconomics, critiquing how the child works in the service of capital and the nation-state. importantly, vap reconnects national fantasies about reproductive futurism back to actual children, offering a revised understanding of how contemporary domestic economic and legislative policies actually undermine the very social vitality the child supposedly indexes. her work thus speaks back to the commodification of children, offering a poetics of embodiment that rematerializes the abstract figure of the child.80

universal basic income as utopian demand: 
labor, value, and the radical imaginary
 ■kelly happe, university of georgia
this paper argues that the call for  
a universal basic income (ubi) by feminists and the movement for black lives is an anti-capitalist utopian demand capable of embracing feminist, queer, and critical race theories of labor and value. building on the idea of ubi as an exemplar of the provocation and collectivity of the demand insofar as it frees us from the wage relation and the family, this paper argues that can further avoid the otherwise invisibilization  of genders, races, and sexualities  in anti-capitalist theory and social movement praxis.

“city of ladies”: christine de pizan’s  
proto-feminist, utopic “safe space”
 ■alyse knorr, regis university
while christine de pizan’s writing has 
been compared to other authors from her period, work remains to be done on the similarities of her rhetoric with that of contemporary feminist political activists. in particular, this paper will examine the proto-feminist utopia sketched out in christine’s the book of the city of ladies, focusing on representations of gendered violence. christine’s rhetorical moves prefigure those of today’s #metoo campaign, emphasizing the movements of purging, collecting, and community-building. this progression shapes a feminist construction of a utopic space that is powerful not as a finalized product, but as an ongoing, collectively-imagined process.
repro-capitalism and the racial logics of  
the handmaid’s tale
 ■sujata moorti, middlebury college
hulu’s adaptation of margaret atwood’s 
dystopian novel, the handmaid’s tale, appears to be an apt response to the contemporary political climate in the us. i have developed the concept the repro-capitalism to underscore the ways in which the series showcases the intertwined logics of capitalism and the compulsions of reproduction. drawing on critical race theories, understandings of reproductive futurity, and scholarship on afro-pessimism, my analysis highlights the ways in which the female capacity to reproduce becomes the site from which race is re-articulated in keeping with a broader neoliberal project.

walking away: le guin on revolutionary acts

 ■lisa mcleod, guilford college
the theme of leaving an unjust society 
to create another, more just society—although “justice” is not her terminology for this choice—is found repeatedly in ursula k. le guin’s works, from the celebrated the dispossessed and  “the ones who walk away from omelas” to lesser known works, like  the eye of the heron. in this paper,  i will explore how le guin addresses accountability for unintended harms and the passive benefiting from others’ exploitation, and ways in which her daoist leanings informed her conceptions of choosing otherwise.

2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: friday, november 9the 2018 nwsa theme compels us to

lesbian feminisms, hysterical pleasure,  
and ethics for end times
 ■gina abelkop, university of georgia
the novel we love venus! performs 
and troubles the ethics of pleasure during mass environmental catastrophe. in the surrealist near-future american landscape of the novel, houses are shaped like donuts, the two queer protagonists go  
by a single “we,” performance art becomes feminist currency, and flowers, the last thriving remnants of vegetation, have been co-opted as the image of choice by politically conservative movements. playing at the intersections  
of lesbian feminist ethics, ecofeminism, and joy decidedly unbound from happiness, the novel explores radical embodiment and alternative kinship systems as essential tools of protest.
biography of my automaton
 ■ginger ko, university of georgia
in biography of my automaton,  the author explores the ethics of our automated futures and how postcolonial automation has the potential to either perpetuate or modify how we presently impact the environment. the work utilizes surrealist magnification to project the future through language and the potential for more than utilitarian motivations in the coding of technology.
dressing for utopia
 ■sofia thanhauser, pratt institute
the contemporary clothing system operates within and as a discourse that produces and consolidates models of femininity that allow for hyper exploitation of women around the world. its immense plasticity and power enables women to exploit and be exploited in one motion, all in the name of ever greater liberation. i argue that the effort to imagine a new clothing system is one that demands imagining new spacio-temporal configurations of labor and creative practice, agricultural practice, and aesthetics that will necessarily unfold in tandem with the production of new subject positions.

black queer time and space in dionne

 ■megan spencer, university of california, 
santa barbara
in this paper i offer a reading of dionne 
brand’s poetry collection “no language is neutral”, articulating the ways that black liberation queers time. drawing on theorizations of the archive and temporality by saidiya hartman and kara keeling, i describe how brand’s poems offer, through their attention to land/seascapes and erotic relationships between black caribbean women, a disruption of colonial temporalities that illuminates the ongoing gendered presence of antiblack racism. brand’s poems allow black lesbian desire to exist beyond the parameters of geographic and temporal normativity, and thus offer a mode of unintelligibility from which to imagine black queer futures.

 ■amoni thompson, university of california,

understanding of a black sense of place as a geographical perspective that accounts for how legacies of racial violence produce black being, i argue that a black (girl) sense of place is informed by notions of community, expressive culture, and physical location, and is used in the subversion of containment and anti-black racism. i address the following inquiry: how does black girlhood function as a spatial imaginary? i situate this research question within the theoretical foundation of black geographies, exploring how black girls recuperate a sense of place and contribute to the radical imagining of freedom.

manifesto for social change”
 ■analouise keating, texas woman’s university
in light in the dark/luz en lo oscuro: 
rewriting identity, spirituality, reality, gloria anzaldúa offers a provocative theory of imagination as an agent of ontological change. when we engage our imagination and enter boldly into dialogues with imaginal figures, spirits, trees, and/or “guardian spirit[s],” we can “change or reinvent reality” (44). drawing on anzaldúa’s ontological imagination and adrienne marie brown’s theory of emergent strategy , this paper offers three tactics that can be harnessed for social change.
“reimagining coalitional futures with 
anzaldúa’s nagualan consciousness”
 ■kelli zaytoun, wright state university
feminist social justice work in the 21st 
century requires new theories about and practical strategies related to the role of individual persons in group-based efforts. this paper explores how the imagination is central to what i refer to as the self-in-coalition, a theory that builds on gloria anzaldúa’s practice of subjectivity called “naguala” /shapeshifting. this paper brings into scholarly, critical conversation the indigenous ontologies upon which anzaldúa’s “shapeshifting” consciousness is based, therefore offering an example of how alternatives to western thought can contribute to a practical plan for coalition building.
“imaginative anzaldúan realities: a  
collective consciousness”
 ■jessica camp, texas woman’s university
“imagination opens the road to  
both personal and societal change – transformation of self, consciousness, community, culture, society”  (anzaldúa 83).
gloria anzaldúa suggests that 
imagination is an integral tool for transformative change. her writings integrate decolonizing knowledges as storytelling in the form of autohistoria and autohistoria-teoría. through a discussion of anzaldúan theories such as la facultad, this paper explores the way that autohistoria reimagines the idea of knowledge of self and calls for radical, political change.”
“anzaldúan imagining of home: profound 
homelessness and its relationship to the imagination”
 ■betsy dahms, university of west georgia
this presentation explores gloria 
anzaldúa’s theorizing on alienation in her concept of being “del otro lado” in relation to her queer world-making project of el mundo zurdo, a visionary mode of relationality where community is created based on affinities and not on sameness. exploring a broad landscape of alienation in terms of homelessness, this presentation will look to anzaldúa’s short story “reading lp” as an example of how extreme homelessness makes the imagination one of the only spaces where a different reality is possible. anzaldúa’s theorization of the imagination insists on the materiality of the imagination to create new realities.

beyond precarity: reading trans of color 
bodies fungible(ly)
 ■v varun chaudhry, northwestern university
the current political moment has 
included visibility for trans people of color alongside intensified (gendered and racialized) subjugation, leading some scholars to theoretically frame the present as “precarious.” in this paper i posit “fungibility” rather than “precarity” as a more robust theorization of trans of color bodies and experiences, utilizing what tiffany king, saidiya hartman, and hortense spillers have called black fungibility. using ethnographic research with trans people of color in us-based nonprofit and funding agencies, i examine how “fungibility” might proffer a more expansive and potentially just reading of how trans people of color strategically navigate institutional power
afro trans vivências: reassembling transness, 
blackness and feminism
 ■dora santana, john jay college
the author focuses on “mais viva,” a 
term in brazilian portuguese that can be roughly translated as “more alive, alert, savvy.” she theorizes the concept as embodied knowledge of black and trans resistance. the author argues that brazilian “travesti” activist selen ravache’s story is an instantiation of trans feminist work that taps on the afro-diasporic legacy of “fugitivity” as refusal to lose oneself, even when one self constitutes transformation. she foregrounds black trans experiences from the south hemisphere in relationship to transnational debates to reassemble the ways we understand, move within, and intersect black, trans and feminist studies.
crip trans epistemologies, trans of color 
justice, survival, and prison abolition
 ■elias vitulli, center for popular democracy
this paper will examine incarcerated 
gender nonconforming and trans people’s survival strategies, resistance, critiques of the prison system, and articulations of justice in the mid- to late twentieth century. drawing from archival research, gay and lesbian and prisoner newspapers, and court documents, i will center the work and writing of gender nonconforming and trans people of color to think through what trans of color justice and worldmaking has looked like inside penal institutions. i will connect their ideas to what i call a crip trans analytic, grounded in women of color and queer of color critique, to articulate a coalitional framework.
transmisogny and its discontents
 ■eli erlick, university of california, santa cruz
transmisogyny, coined in 2007 by transgender academic julia serano, represents an assemblage of violence against transgender women and has grown rapidly in mainstream popularity. however, is transmisogyny enough 87
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: friday, november 9to comprehend the violence against 
transgender people when it is primarily black trans women experiencing the harshest forms of brutality? this paper represents how we can (and must) complicate articulations of intrusions on the body within the state of identity politics that universalize whiteness. i argue for the usage of a framework centering racialization and knowledge as a methodology that may be able to understand and ultimately end violence.

reading humanely: feminist speculation in

 ■catherine fairfield, university of michigan
this paper interrogates how naomi 
alderman’s speculative fiction novel, the power, explores the interrelations of social sustainability and the concept of the humane within the context of a profound biological change to the human species. alderman imagines a world in which women are given the biological ability to gain power over men through exerting physical, political, and social dominance. by exploring human ethics amidst posthuman transformation, i will address the central question of whether feminist speculative fiction that is invested in narratives of biologically grounded power can - or should - be read reparatively.
nuclear families and other toxic kin
 ■sarah ensor, university of michigan
this paper studies the non-normative paradigms of relation that burgeon under conditions of acute and lingering toxicity - specifically the chernobyl exclusion zone - in order to theorize modes of radioactive embodiment, relationality, and temporality. by demonstrating the extent to which benefit, not simply damage, can itself be collateral, sites of nuclear fallout allow us to trace not only the forms of slow violence for which they are widely known, but also forms of slow, gradual, and oft imperceptible intimacy that have emerged in their midst - and that remain unmeasured by instruments of biopolitical surveillance that track the health of the bodies involved.

sexual revolution in islam: state, muslim 
politics and feminist activism in malaysia
 ■azza basarudin, university of california,  
los angeles
political islam is increasingly the defining 
element of malaysian policies and national projects. same-sex sexual acts are criminalized under the penal code and of late, the state has stepped up the moral policing of malay-muslim queer bodies. this paper analyzes the marginalization of queer activists in the malaysian-muslim feminist movement. while malaysian-muslim feminist troublemakers have advanced a rights-based revolution in islam, they have not sufficiently addressed sexual rights and criminalization of queer muslims. as such, what are the ways that this rights-based revolution in islam can be reimagined as a radical feminist vision of sexual revolution?
utopian visions of redress: reimagining 
gender justice in the indian comic
 ■sharmila lodhia, santa clara university
this paper examines the transformative 
potential of “priya’s shakti,” india’s first augmented reality comic which incorporates real-life stories of gendered violence as an advocacy tool. this analysis is situated within a broader socio-cultural study of female protagonists and superheroines in contemporary indian comics. comics provide a unique canvas for the exploration of imaginative landscapes of gender relations. storylines incorporating myth, fantasy and the supernatural, offer readers alternative spaces of belonging and being in the world. they furnish a blueprint for more nuanced explorations of the complexities surrounding gendered violence and one with the potential to reach new and inform audiences.

 ■catherine zehra sameh, university of

“while legal constraints have forestalled 
gender equality nearly 40 years after the 1979 iranian revolution, dramatic shifts in practices and conceptions of intimate life point to feminism as a persistent “revolutionary” current. this paper will rethink dominant conceptions of political revolution, asking after the spaces of everyday life to theorize the intimate contours of social transformation. in what ways is everyday life revolutionary, prefiguring a feminist present and future?”

activism deployed affect to argue that central to many caribbean social movements is a playful engagement with joyful affect. it examines how both the the salsa music movement and the young lords performed “affective activism,” which engaged sincerely with political and social issues while also deploying joy as a political tool. it further argues that the masculinist politics often found in white u.s.-based movements are used to discredit this affective activism, but positing a gendered dialectic between serious and joy where the latter is assumed  to be both feminine and apolitical.
queer descent, queer dissent: the case  
of the chilean cueca
 ■christine hasson gilfrich, texas  
woman’s university
within the context of a post-dictatorial 
chile, the political legacy of biopower shapes chilean society in general, and the cueca (chile’s national dance) in particular. the effects of biopolitics on this cultural performance are extremely important when one takes into account the heavy focus on body and embodiment. despite the heteronormativity invoked by this paired dance, gilfrich argues, first, that the genealogy of the cueca makes the dance inherently queer and second, that this queerness generates a space for challenging the status quo and imagining a new future.

this workshop explores the successes 
and challenges of the newly-formed black girls equity alliance (bgea) in mobilizing policy makers, system actors, and community members in dismantling oppressive social structures and institutions. based on feminist theoretical perspectives that highlight and challenge how system-involved girls are frequently blamed by the systems that attempt to “fix” them, the bgea was founded on the premise that it is our systems that need fixing. during this workshop session, participants will describe the specific process of operationalizing this theoretical shift and invite discussion on how to continue to “demand the impossible” in reorganizing our youth-serving systems.

room 219unlosing trans lives: autobiography, 
vulnerability, and resistance
 ■rushaan kumar, colorado college
with the tabling of the regressive 
transgender bill in the indian parliament, many transgender indians face increased “infrastructural vulnerability” (butler, 2016). while the state disciplines trans embodiment by mandating identity certification and criminalizing various paths to livelihood, trans people are constructing ways to resist their disposability within this regime. this paper explores the emergence of trans autobiography as an expressive and ethical form in this context. how do trans people use autobiography to navigate their vulnerability and write themselves into public discourse? how does this form call into existence not only a trans consciousness, but also a broader political community?
the babies of kettleman city: the 
precariousness of mexican social life and death in rural central california
 ■josé manuel santillana, university of 
minnesota
in the last decade, mother jones, cnn, 
abc news, la times, and several other news media outlets have continued covering the rise of stillborn pregnancies and babies born with birth defects in the predominantly mexican immigrant town of kettleman city, california. utilizing discourse analysis, this paper seeks to centralize these communities as a point of departure that can orient us to a more nuanced understanding of racialized socialites of life/death, environmentalism and resistance. doing so helps us underline the feminist underpinnings of and by which counter-insurgent and situated knowledges come to form in the face of multiple violences.
the disability of queerness: towards new

 ■sayan bhattacharya, university of

this paper argues that any analysis 
of south asian queer movements 89
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: friday, november 9is incomplete without deploying 
disability as an analytic. be it how laws write transgender bodies as always already disabled and hence needing rehabilitation to suicides of queer students due to lack of mental health support at school, the intersections between queer and disability movements in the region are palpable. yet, given the history of pathologization of non-normative identities, queer movements often disavow disability in its aspirations towards attaining citizenship. however, which queer bodies can become able-bodied? could thinking with disability engender new possibilities for imagining queer transnationally?
towards a theory of black educational life: 
reimagining black student life in  teacher preparation
 ■ezekiel joubert iii, university of minnesota
much of educational research about 
and for black people focus on the disposability and dispossession of black students. drawing from critical scholarship, i explore how centering a curriculum of tragedy in teacher preparation can stifle productive interrogations of educational structures--namely ideology and power that reproduce race, class, gender, and sexual orientation and diminish the construction of effective pedagogies that reduce racial violence in schools. through a critical analysis of the discursive practices produced by predominantly white preservice teachers, this paper seeks to theorize the possibilities of black educational life to reclaim black educational futurity.

 ■melissa w. wright, penn state university
the promise to build a “big beautiful”

gender, militarism, and testimonies of 
resistance during latin america’s “dirty wars”
 ■viviana beatriz macmanus, occidental college
this paper examines women’s 
involvement in the armed struggles in argentina and mexico during the “dirty wars” (1960-1980s). the presentation centers on the gender politics of argentina’s and mexico’s military state projects, as well as the gender dynamics within leftist resistance movements targeted by the state. turning to interviews i conducted with former guerrilleras, this paper explores how women challenged the masculinist military projects of the state, as well as the leftist organizations to which these women belonged. their narratives call for a transnational feminist consideration of women’s political resistance against latin american masculinist  military projects.
militarism and the gendered politics of 
policing in contemporary uganda
 ■alicia catharine decker, penn state 
university
in 2001, president yoweri museveni 
appointed a high-ranking military officer to head the uganda police force, an institution that had been in civilian hands for nearly a century. not surprisingly, this shift was profoundly gendered, not just in terms of who had access to power, but also in terms of how power and security were (re)defined. this paper, which is based on in-depth interviews with more than two dozen high-ranking police women in uganda, as well as numerous lower-level operatives, explores the complex intersections of gender and militarism in “civilian” policing—a force that still remains under military control.

 ■velina manolova, graduate center, city 
university of new york
lorraine hansberry’s play les blancs 
(1970) intervenes in both liberal and anti-colonial versions of masculinist humanist thought and cultural production to assert an “impossible” demand for a feminist and queer vision of racial justice. responding to both the “erotic shadows” projected onto jean genet’s black characters in his play the blacks (1960) and frantz fanon’s sexist and homophobic projections onto the colonized in his otherwise incisive anti-racist text black skin, white masks (1953), hansberry unmasks the intersecting dimensions of willful ignorance in patriarchal and racist humanisms that circumscribe the category of the human worthy of complex,

 ■rocio pichon riviere, university of  
california, riverside
as an intervention in the intellectual 
history of latin american feminism, this paper historicizes a genealogy of thought that began in the 1950s peru and brazil and lives on in contemporary argentina. threading together the phenomenologies of rhythm and interpellation by afro-peruvian choreographer victoria santa cruz, jewish-brazilian modernist writer lispector, and trans activist marlene wayar, this essay proposes a theory of the social production of willful ignorance that sees it (with thinking eyes) as a choreography of gazes, skin, and rhythms in segregated urban space to map epistemic claims in the social dynamics of everyday life and to imagine alternatives.077. academic arrebatos: collective

“somos una fantasia”: violence, belonging

 ■andrea bolivar, university of michigan
this paper ethnographically centers the 
lives of sex working transgender latinas in chicagoland. i introduce “fantasia” as a queer analytic to illustrate the unique ways in which transgender latinas are racialized and dehumanized in sexual economies of labor and the u.s. more broadly. fantasia indexes their ephemeral presence—they are always at risk of disappearing on account of their race and gender, and the ways in which the two come together. yet, it also reveals potentiality. the women described creatively use their bodies to survive and at times thrive, by engaging in resistant forms of labor, kinship, and space-making.

such as representations from reality tv and of reality tv stars, interviews with black southern female rapper, trina, and ethnographic field research of southern black lesbian recreation events, this paper explores how the hip hop south and its music, entertainment, and sexual economy fosters a contemporary bass counter-culture  and cultivates interstitial black queer sexual geographies such as the southern strip club/party space, which functions as a sonic sexual playground, where black queer femmes access crevices of power, androgynous gender play, and lesbian pleasure appear.
the revolutionary politics of intersectionality: 
latinx exclusion and inclusion in media representations of the victims of the pulse nightclub shooting
 ■doug meyer, university of virginia
intersectional approaches have 
frequently critiqued frameworks that incorporate multiply-marginalized groups while continuing to privilege a single axis of oppression. building on these critiques, my analysis emphasizes media reports of the pulse nightclub shooting that included latinx queer people in their coverage, yet did so in ways that bolstered anti-feminist aims. as this paper highlights how traditional frameworks may include, as well as exclude, multiply-marginalized groups, the author argues for radical resistance through intersectional feminist approaches, in which revolutionary work can move beyond perfunctory inclusion and toward a more robust incorporation of latinx queer people that transforms structures of inequality.

“contemporary feminist critiques of 
sexism, sexual assault, and sexual violence are shaping popular global discourse, moving the feminist conversation beyond the hallowed confines of college campuses and academic journals. in this transition from intellectual marginality to cultural dominance, one can trace deep fissures emerging between feminism’s dual character as an analytical and politically prescriptive project. there is a split between feminist methodology and ethics marked by cannibalism, whereby the community of feminists, are eating each other. a productive dialogue forward would be to pursue deep thinking on modalities of toxic masculinity and heteropatriarchal strictures that operate to destroy people’s lives.”

mourning and holding funerals for kurdish guerrillas as these funerals are considered threat for the sovereign state. honor crime victims are denied proper burial for being accused of ‘ruining’ the family’s reputation. kurdish women activists in turkey are going against the grain by holding funerals for both women and setting public protests since 2000s against the necropolitics of the state and patriarchal powers which establish exceptions to control life and death. this paper analyzes the ways in which women activists take action by 95

connections in color: suzanne césaire 
the blended resistance re-orients debates about the participation of black women in the cultural, philosophical and literary movement created in paris in the 1930s known as negritude. i am interested in suzanne césaire’s transnational call for unity and solidarity in the black community that helped them challenge gender norms, sexuality and racism. i will do a close reading of two of her essays, 1) “malaise of a civilization” and 2) “the great camouflage,” using both the french and english version to analyze her focus on gender norms in the caribbean, sexuality and racism.
self-invention and the radical leap in 
revolutionary grenada
 ■jamie ann rogers, university of  
california, irvine
this presentation interrogates 
representations of memory, suicide, and the queer diaspora in dionne brand’s novel in another place, not here, and steve mcqueen’s video carib’s leap. the works, i argue, represent moments of revolution and resistance as occurring within everyday acts and intimate relations, refusing revolutionary paradigms that can easily be named in advance. instead, they propose multiple forms of resistances, some unsettling, that “leap” into radical self-invention. such imaginings, i conclude, offer visions in which another world is possible, while at the same time refusing to shirk from the physical and psychic toll of laboring toward that world.the climactic route to freedom
 ■bianca beauchemin, university of california, 
los angeles
this project seeks to re-interpret 
the legendary slave rebellion of saint-domingue by uncovering the revolutionary potential of sexuality. complicating dominant discourses of victimhood and sexual assault, this study proposes that erotic intimacies played an integral role within freedom narratives. in opposition to a heteronormative articulation of black sexuality, this research aims to situate queer sexual freedom within the locus of the black radical tradition. by re-defining the boundaries of what a sexual revolution could be outside of a western context, this scholarly intervention strives to re-member the haitian revolution through the lens of a queerly diasporic black sexual agency.

the power of gordibuena erotics: 
transnational latinas creating a fat sex-positive praxis
 ■yessica garcia hernandez, university of 
california, san diego
i investigate the transnational social 
media movement of gordibuenas (sexy fat women) who use art, photography, performance, music, and film to push for sex-positive spaces that celebrates excess in food, fatness, and sex. i employ the concept of “gordibuena erotics,” to theorize the sex-positive praxis that transnational latinas are constructing, which claims the power of the erotic found in dancing the fat pussy, eating food in abundance, engaging with pornography and unapologetically enjoying “gordaputear” (fat sluttiness). the gordibuena intervention invites fat latinas to center their fantasies during sexual interactions and enjoy the fat orgasms that their bodies desire.
gorda sin verguenza: theorizing  
fat latina consciousness ■monica hernandez, arizona state university
fat latinas navigate a complex terrain 
of mixed ideas and practices about their racialized fat bodies, an area of study that’s tellingly understudied. here, i weave personal narrative with feminist materialist literature, disability studies and borderlands theory to construct a fat latina “autohistoria-teoría” (anzaldua, 2002). theorizing fat latinas in this way is a reclamation of our bodyminds as empowered embodied agents. it’s a call to explore the meaning of continued invisibility of fat latinas in feminist spaces, despite a rich tradition of inquiry by them. it promotes a praxis of intersectional resistance and advocates for necessary activation of radical self-love.
how to be an imperfect fat chicana nerd
 ■monica de la torre, arizona state university
complex media representations of latinas are practically nonexistent. the awkward, not conventionally attractive, and chubby chicana with her nose in a book is an identity i know very well, but have yet to see abundantly on mainstream pop culture. fat chicana nerds are waiting to be discovered in indie bookstores (i am not your perfect mexican daughter and violence girl) or are cancelled after one season on air (cristela). drawing from film, television, and literature i examine how fat chicana nerds use their bodies to resist and inhabit spaces never imagined for working class chicanas.

“carnival does not know footlights”: 
rethinking utopia in katherine dunn’s  geek love
 ■stevi costa, university of washington
performance studies scholars, especially 
those interested in the circus arts, have long leveraged bakhtin’s carnivalesque to illuminate the utopian character of the circus and its affiliates. “in fact, carnival does not know footlights,” bakhtin writes, “everyone participates because its very idea embraces all the people” (7). such utopian readings of the circus, highlight the imagined sense of equality, allowing for an anticipatory illumination of what the world could be. katherine dunn’s geek love critiques the circus as a utopian space to instead imagine a world of matrilineal, collective kinship in which visibly disabled women care for and about each other.

“the device”
 ■angela rovak, university of oregon
eve ewing’s story “the device” collapses 
the past and the future as a young black girl speaks across time to her enslaved great-great-great grandmother. this story presents what alondra nelson names reconciliation projects. ewing’s attempt at future reconciliation disrupts linear time, showing that a just future must contend with the past. as toni morrison argues, “when you kill the ancestor you kill yourself” (1040). the story ends with the ancestor’s uncontrollable laughter that interrupts a successful reconciliation. this paper argues that ewing’s story draws out the specific questions of a black radical tradition to the project of speculative matrilineal futures.094. hashtag activisms,

 ■devon betts
in the 22 years since marlon riggs’ 
black is…black ain’t was released, there’s been substantial progress in the management of hiv/aids, but this progress has been unilateral. the discourse around the #truvadawhore movement has generated intense discussions amongst queer and medical communities, but little attention has been given to the voices that are being centered in these conversations. a queer of color critique exposes the numerous ways that this movement depends on and perpetuates a hegemonic gay identity. this project calls for a queering and reimaging of the #truvadawhore through an exploration of the question: who gets to be a #truvadawhore?
“#hear her harvard”: sororities as sites of 
incomplete educational revolution
 ■jocelyne bartram scott, indiana university-
purdue university columbus
in 2018 harvard university instituted 
a ban on greek organizations. the decision incurred nationwide backlash from sorority women using the hashtag #hearherharvard. the women reminded spectators that sororities were created in revolutionary response to widespread disapproval of women’s co-education and advocated for their continued effectiveness. what was obscured by this response, however, was the concurrent history of exclusionary membership practices within sororities. i use #hearherharvard to expose the contemporary tensions and inconsistencies in sororities’ efforts to transform college for all women. i ask if, despite their homogenized memberships, sororities’ longstanding agitation for gender equality in education warrants their continued existence.
reinventing sexual justice
 ■sarah clark miller, penn state university
the #metoo moment represents a collective rape culture reckoning and demands a much-needed evaluation of the status of sexual justice in the u.s. and across the globe. in response, this paper argues for a reinvention of sexual justice guided by two methodologies rooted in feminist pluralism. first, queer feminist approaches shift the conversation from a focus on harm to also incorporate pleasure, desire, and sexual freedom. second, drawing simultaneously on methodologies long practiced in women of color feminisms and transnational feminism, intersectionality and self-criticism emerge as key approaches  for challenging mainstream feminism  
 to overcome the exclusionary logics  at its core.

disabled black and indigenous 
girls—including two spirit, queer, trans girls—are disproportionately killed while incarcerated in canada and the united states. i explore how settler, carceral states deploy “carceral humanitarianism” (gilmore 2017). as the state rushes to recast the in-custody murders of girls as matters of immediate crisis response, individual failure, and mental fragility, i advance historical and contemporary case studies of “mad” girls engaging in strategies and tactics of resistance that are part of what audra simpson (2014) calls the “cartography of refusal.”
losing the black queer girl-child in lauren

i synthesize discourses of oppositional

 ■mara holt, ohio university
i conducted a pilot study of a cultural 
competencies curriculum for first-year english, and found that because many students of color and queer students preferred not to sign the (intimidating) consent form, their voices were not present. anonymity requirements made it practically impossible to work with diverse students who wanted to participate in follow-up teacher training. my paper reimagines my study without the irb constraints that are supposed  
to protect students but instead inadvertently silence the population that has the most to offer such research.  
i explore possibilities of more ethical and consequential activist research practices.
composing queer(ly), composing 
multimodally: subverting print-based structures through/in queer comics and zines
 ■rachael ryerson, ohio university
this presentation considers how 
college students compose queer(ly) and multimodally to disrupt structural, discursive impediments to queer world-making. through the queer comics and zines students composed for an undergraduate writing course, this presentation imagines how classrooms and pedagogies might foster queer, multimodal meaning making if they are physically and ideologically structured to support queer rhetorical practices that disrupt (hetero)normative constraints (alexander and rhodes). students in their material, multimodal, diy meaning making, demonstrate how current and future writing spaces and policies can be subverted to (re)present and (un)know queer/ness.
teaching land as an extension of self: the 
role of ecopsychology in disrupting capitalist narratives of land and resource exploitation
 ■allison ricket, ohio university
ecopsychology, which investigates 
the human-nature relationship, draws on marginalized ways of knowing such as native american shamanism, “whole earth thinking,” and the dynamic feminine (gomez & kanner). impediments of literal classroom walls and systemic bias against unquantifiable course outcomes limits pedagogy. traditional pedagogical approaches to environmental curriculum reinforce perceived helplessness under capitalist forces which identify land only as exploitable (hooks). this paper imagines classrooms without spatial limitations and state policed “standards” that now enforce normative identity constructs. students could explore biophilia, awakening a powerful, dormant identity which expands the self to include the entire biosphere.

 ■erica leigh lange, ohio university
grading, which is overdetermined by

in toni morrison’s sula and sean baker’s tangerine as forming alternate, protective kinships. drawing on audre lorde’s (1984) concept of the erotic and amber jamilla musser’s (2014) reading of lorde, the paper imagines friendship as a place for exchanges of joy and respite from the disenfranchisement of black women in mid-twentieth century ohio as well as from the hypervisibility of black trans women in 2015 los angeles. tracing parallels between the works, the paper argues that friendship allows these characters to form a chosen other, diminishing the power of continual social other-ing in hostile environments.

this paper examines linkages between

cryptogamic soils are multi-species 
communities, plentiful in the deserts  of the u.s. southwest, a place cared  for by southern paiute, ute, navajo, hopi, and pueblo people, but cast as “empty” in the settler colonial stories that enable continued conquest of land and bodies. cryptogamic sand-plant assemblages are necessary for all life in the desert— their coming together, unintentional, barely noticeable, yet worlding. taking these soil communities as companions for thinking, this paper seeks to imagine possible land, bodies, and temporalities in other-than-colonial stories, made legible in the necessary, and “queer,” multispecies intimacies  of cryptogamic soil.101

re-envisioning the female subaltern:  
toward a model of multispecies justice
 ■sharon n. tran, university of maryland, 
baltimore county
this paper examines the postcolonial 
feminist model of ecocriticism and multispecies justice proposed in larissa lai and rita wong’s collaborative poem, sybil unrest. the artists invite us to reflect on how the ecocritical turn can perpetuate the marginalization/erasure of the female subaltern, who has been historically afforded very limited parameters of visibility. i argue that sybil unrest advances a critique of the fetishistic visual economy of gendered, racialized flesh while simultaneously cultivating subversive practices of looking. the poem promotes an expanded ecological frame of vision that keeps both the possibilities and predicaments that bind human and nonhuman bodies in view.

generates a rich and necessary conversation between black feminist thought and disability studies, bringing these two seemingly disparate fields together at the site of black women’s contemporary speculative fiction. looking to octavia butler, nalo hopkinson, n.k. jemisin, phyllis alesia perry, and shawntelle madison, schalk amplifies the power, potential, and pleasures of literary worlds in which given hierarchies of race, gender, and ability no longer hold traction. using non-realist devices such as time-travel, shape-shifting, and non-human characters, these black women writers re-imagine the possibilities and meanings attached to bodyminds—what schalk defines as the mutual imbrication of the mental and physical—and in so doing, provoke us to question governing assumptions around (dis)ability, race, gender, and sexuality. bodyminds reimagined thus foregrounds the disruptive capacity of black women’s speculative fiction to challenge the rules of reality, bringing us into contact with worlds that productively defamiliarize  
our own.

gestures of spirituality, interconnectivity,  
and creativity: exploring relations among and beyond the human in anzaldúa’s archived drawings
 ■sara ishii, texas woman’s university
gloria anzaldúa drew important 
connections between spirituality, interconnectivity, and creativity when she stated “the idea that everything is spiritual, that i’m a speck of this soul, this creative consciousness, this creative life force; and so is a dog, a rock, a bird, this bedspread, and this wall…everything is relative, i’m related to everything” (interviews 100). my paper examines this tryptic in a selection of anzaldúa’s archived drawings. placing her humans, animals, and nature sketches into conversation with her written theories, i analyze how anzaldúa uses imagination to articulate a spirituality that develop relations between humans and our environment.
“possibilities for transformation: gloria e. 
anzaldúa’s creative acts as contemplative practices in higher education”
 ■carla nikol wilson, texas woman’s 
university
gloria anzaldúa emphasized creative 
acts as consciousness raising when she claimed, “a form of spiritual inquiry, conocimiento is reached via creative acts — writing, art-making, dancing, healing, teaching, meditation, and spiritual activism (light 1 19). my paper explores implementing creative acts as contemplative practices with the capacity to demand the impossible within higher education, more specifically within a social justice classroom. contemplative practices offer radical ways of being, knowing, and relating within the individual (inner acts) and in the world (public acts). i offer strategies for including contemplative practices in the classroom in order to create possibilities for personal and social transformation.
“spirituality for social change”: examining 
the transformative possibilities of gloria e. anzaldúa’s speculative fiction
 ■kristin alder, texas woman’s university
gloria anzaldúa’s speculative 
fiction interrogates and challenges oppressive narratives of racism, sexism, and heterosexism by infusing the art form with socially- and
 
 politically-
oriented consciousness.  
 through the 
examination of race, gender, and sexuality, anzaldúa (re)creates and (re)claims identities, histories, and futures in works which not only protest social injustice, but additionally offer new frameworks and theories for understanding and movement building. using both her published and archived work, i argue that anzaldúa’s fiction is spiritual activism in which she imagines models of creative transformation which both critique current logics of dualistic thinking and oppression and offers possibilities for resistance and change.
 
“through spirituality we seek balance and 
harmony”: gloria anzaldúa’s self-growth/social change interplay
 ■jessica fairuza sadr, texas woman’s university
gloria anzaldúa calls the spiritual 
search for meaning a “yearning and an essential human need to witness the flow of life” (light 39). while this yearning is often framed individualistically in western society – spiritual journeys are about personal growth – anzaldúa takes a more collectivist perspective. she believes that spirituality facilitates personal growth but also that spiritual practices uniquely catalyze positive social transformation – inner and collective change are inseparable. 
my paper examines how this spiritually-
inflected self-growth/social change interplay functioned in anzaldúa’s life to cull suggestions for evoking 103

“there is hope against hope for a new

 ■ellen kohl, st. mary’s college of maryland
people living in environmental justice 
communities face an uphill battle making material changes in their communities. even though environmental justice activists’ often focus on one particular environmental concern, in practice they are contesting the institutionalized intersectional oppressions that created and subsequently maintain the inequitable distribution of environmental hazards. drawing on over five years of participant observation with the newtown florist club (nfc), i examine how the women of the nfc sustain their long-term engagement in their fight against injustices through diverse social movement strategies, a commitment to their beloved community, and their own faith to imagine a new future.
hummingbird, unbowed: wangari maathai, 
the kenyan greenbelt movement & the black feminist spatial imagination
 ■kishi animashaun ducre, syracuse university
this is a case study of wangari maathai 
and her intersectional campaign for gender, economic, and environmental justice through the greenbelt movement of kenya. awarded a nobel in 2004, she has often been reduced to an environmental activist; yet, her mission included confronting patriarchy and dehumanizing effects of capital development. her 2006 memoir, unbowed is an articulation of a black feminist spatial imagination. this presentation contributes to the following questions posed by nwsa’s cfp: what do those in the margins, on the borderlands, in the interstices, and below the radar tell us about imagining a different kind of future?
free the land, save the black future: black 
women’s strategies for environmental justice
 ■danielle m purifoy, university of north 
carolina at chapel hill
throughout the environmental justice 
movement, black women have operated as decoders and translators of legal and political encumbrances that shape and sacrifice their lands. but land use planning principles and visions for alternative development attempt to cull blackness from space itself. though perhaps not all be “utopian”, black women’s labor and resistance aims at “freeing” land from routine and predictably harmful fates, creating new possibilities for black placemaking. this paper explores the work of black women in three southern places to identify common principles and practices, and develop a framework  
for preserving (if not defining) the future of black spaces.

 ■david tenorio, university of pittsburgh
this presentation problematizes the latin 
american and caribbean imaginaries of radical change inherited from two pivotal sociocultural phenomena from the 20th century: the cuban and mexican revolutions. it examines the legacy of a revolutionary teleology of progress and its divergences, collisions, and contradictions vis-à-vis the cultural production of historically marginalized queer collectives in both contexts. in particular, el ciervo encantado’s performance triunfadella (2015) from cuba and roberto cabral’s cabaret performance roberta y las otras chicas del montón from mexico engage in  
a queer critique of history while enacting a resignification of space, temporality, and affect through their fleeting performances.
trans subjectivity and mexican counter publics 
to the narcosphere
 ■liliana c gonzalez, university of  
tennessee, knoxville
this paper examines the mexican 
film victorio (201 1) directed by alex noppel and armando croda and the intimate politics of counter publics within the narcosphere–––the site where the public sphere becomes interceded by the political interests behind the “war on drugs.” i analyze victorio as an audio-visual narrative that constructs a space of resistance against the u.s.-mexico narcosphere. as michel foucault reminds us “conduct” and “counter-conduct” cannot exist without the other. hence, i show how victorio not only embodies counter-conducts but also expresses emergent and alternative possibilities for queer and trans subjectivities against the grain of the narcosphere.
indigenous festive dances and/as gestures  
of a mexican queer indigeneity
 ■manuel ricardo cuellar, george  
washington university
this presentation examines the embodied sociality of nahua indigenous males during the performance of a ritualized dance in contemporary mexico. by drawing on fieldwork, i contend that the indigenous festive dance temporarily allows for the enacting or simply gesturing of queer indigenous subjectivities to be imagined and embodied within a heteronormative mestizo nation. as mexican queer indigenous imaginaries remain a precarious possibility, i grapple with the theoretical and practical consequences of looking at the indigenous dance less as a liminal state and more as an embodied structuring mechanism of a nahua community in terms of indigeneity, gender, and sexuality.104

international women’s day mural: a

 ■barbara sutton, university at albany
the “international women’s day mural” 
is a class project held on march 8. the goal is to honor women’s lives and achievements, raise awareness of local and global injustices, and connect symbolically (and sometimes concretely) with activist women around the world. the mural is in a public space where students draw, paint, record statistics, write poetry lines, and disseminate inspirational quotes about women worldwide. while the mural is ephemeral, products with “staying power” include audiovisual documentation of the event and a poem based on students’ collective words (using “poetic analysis” techniques in  the tradition of arts-based research [leavy 2009]).

 ■lauren lichty, university of washington 
bothell
when the university failed to adequately 
incorporate student voice on a committee to address sexual and relationship violence (srv), i developed a seminar, “participatory action research to address srv on our campus.” building off community psychology and public health practices, this class centered students’ experiences, needs, and rights. guided by harris and linder (2017) and hong’s social justice paradigm, students identified existing questions and concerns, and we co-designed an evaluation of campus web-based resources for srv survivors. i will discuss the purpose, goals, activities, and behind the scenes labor to ensure this work did not stop when the course ended.

“citizens and no-bodies: adivasi women,

 ■debali mookerjea-leonard, james  
madison university
using mahasweta devi’s novels shikar 
parba (the hunt canto) and douloti, this paper examines the predicament of adivasi (aboriginal) women within the postcolonial state. it addresses how for adivasi women whose constitutional rights have been infringed and for whom justice is remote, the destruction of the body is the only means of protest. it is through death that madhumanti and douloti—underclass, lower-caste, and female—can speak, and be heard. devi’s writings excavate how adivasi citizenship is marked by inequality and gendered violence – indian citizens on paper, they receive little protection from the law for the breaching of their rights.
chick-lit as disaster relief in the diary

 ■pallavi rastogi, louisiana state university
“moni mohsin’s the diary of a social 
butterfly (2013) uses chick-lit, especially its supposedly superficial plotline, protagonists, and narrative voice, in order to intervene in the india-pakistan conflict, or what i call the “geo-political disaster.” through fashion statements, incomprehensible english, and socialite chatter about parties, butterfly deconstructs the binary between the pakistani self and the indian other.
in refusing to let her life be owned by 
disaster, butterfly ironically propagates an ethical stance towards the other showing how “genre fiction” can do the work of more “serious literature.””

this paper concerns black feminist

 ■banu subramaniam, university of

feminist “new materialism,” has ushered 
in resurgence in theories of matter long discarded by the histories of western bio-medicine. to this end, new materialists have excavated western thought to unearth old theories of vitalist energy and humoral circulations. yet vitalism, and theories of humors have multiple and diverse origin stories, having developed as a conceptual theory of the body across the globe. here, we explore vitalist and humoral theories of the body in biological philosophies from south asia, for example in ayurveda in india. what does uncovering the (post) colonial roots of vitalism add to conversations in feminist new materialism?

despite the potential for a more just

 ■bianca batti, purdue university
in the field of game studies, game 
studies scholars have interrogated what is needed in the study of games (i.e. bogost, 2007; murray, 1997). this conversation highlights the ways certain epistemologies become privileged in game studies and the ways this separation results in the erasure of other disciplinary means of engagement. this paper will argue that this epistemic privileging demonstrates the need for feminist game studies methodologies in order to enact a mode of intersectional worldbuilding that dismantles hegemonic knowledge production in game studies and that creates a more inclusive disciplinary future for additional voices in the field.

 ■rachel elin nolan, university of manchester
in recent decades, feminist historians  
and critical theorists such as kathi weeks 
and nancy fraser have interrogated the complicated gender dynamics of waged labor in the us. this paper engages with this scholarship to examine one of the earliest feminist economic theorists, virginia penny, who argued that women’s participation in a wage economy necessitated new protections: social housing and institutions providing care for women’s bodies and intellectual development. today, as questions about the relation between women’s work and women’s bodily autonomy are newly resurgent, penny’s scholarship offers  
a historical model for navigating tensions between social protection, care,  
and labor.

rhetorics of protection played in two reform projects located in and near chicago in the 1890s: jane addams’s and ellen gates starr’s hull house and amanda berry smith’s orphanage and industrial home for abandoned and destitute colored children. both projects created resources and living arrangements for disadvantaged communities in conversation with progressives’ often-paternalistic hopes for the social restructuring of society. this paper explores the radical potential of these specific cases and asks: how did the organizers legitimize protection of their homes’ inhabitants, and what did they imagine for the inhabitants’ futures?
protecting white capital: the slave ship and 
public housing as defensive architecture
 ■ashlie sandoval, northwestern university
defensive architecture—such as anti-
bum benches and metal spikes—has often been written about as if it were a new trend. i re-contextualize the narrative of defensive architecture by examining it from the position of black lives. drawing from the work of rashad shabbaz and christina sharpe, i explore two types of defensive architecture: the slave ship and the robert taylor homes (1962-2007). i argue that by examining how architecture has been used to transport and contain black bodies, we see that rather than a new trend, defensive architecture exists as a long-established strategy to protect white-owned capital.
queering protection in the contemporary 
german context
 ■anna-lena oldehus, leibniz university  of hannover
in recent years, racist and phobic 
polemics of ultra conservative activists in germany have been amplified, aiming at everyone considered to be non-german. thereby, the unifying theme is that of protection, for which alleged feminist arguments and a gay-friendly rhetoric are coopted and hijacked. in this paper, i discuss the seemingly contradictory dynamics involved in this discourse by making use of the frameworks of german queer theorist antke engel, particularly her notion of ‘caring for conflict’ and the notion of queerness as disruptive force that challenges solid identity categories  
 and undermines logics of  conflicting opposition.
130. killing shame: using 
contemplative practice to defeat internalized oppression
9:30am - 10:45am
room 303 (lcd)
internalized oppression is the self-
loathing or self-harm marginalized populations experience based on the internalization of negative messages from the dominant culture. for example, many women internalize sexist notions of what it is to be female and even aspire to epitomize sexist ideals of womanhood. internalized sexism is exponentially more harmful when combined with internalized racism in the experience of women of color. when homophobic or ableism-based messages are internalized, they further compromise the psychological and social well-being of women. in this session, participants will learn practices they can use daily to recognize and transcend internalized oppression  and shame.

retelling narratives. reclaiming history: 
exploring revenge as catharsis in assassin’s creed freedom cry
 ■kishonna leah gray, university of illinois  
at chicago109
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: friday, november 9 ■cassandra l jones, university of cincinnati
a key strength of futuristic games is 
reclaiming narratives from revisionist history, a central tenet of black feminist thought. black cyberfeminism pushes this framework further by explicating the digital praxis of black women as gamers. by exploring assassin’s creed freedom cry, we ethnographically explore gamers’ engagement with empowered black bodies destroying and dismantling the institution of slavery. freedom cry represents one of the few games to explore a racialized narrative of revenge that allows african-descended peoples to avenge their forefathers (and mothers) through the slaughter of slaveholders and the release of africans from their literal and figurative cages.
problematizing masculinist “content agnostic” 
design practices and reimagining feminist futures through gaming: a case of horizon zero dawn
 ■gabriela t. richard, pennsylvania  
state university
feminist scholars have, for decades, 
suggested a link between the overrepresentation of white men in  the us tech industry, assumptive design practices, and the lack of diversity (kiesler, sproull & eccles, 1985). newer work interrogates the effects of design algorithms in reinforcing structural racism (noble, 2018; garvie & frankle, 2016). this talk discusses horizon zero dawn, a game which focuses on a dystopian yet biodiverse futuristic society where the main woman character, aloy, uncovers a history largely influenced both by masculinist content and feminist-oriented design possibilities. the talk will discuss these narratives in light of contemporary problematic design cultures.
finding ourselves back where we started: 
mass effect andromeda and the difficulty in re-imagining ourselves in an anti-racist, feminist future
 ■kristin ms bezio, university of richmond
in bioware’s 2017 mass effect 
andromeda, the game presents a struggling future utopia set in a new galaxy ostensibly separated from the racism and bias of the milky way. the game acknowledges the impossibility of eliminating historical bias, as bigotry and racialized (alien) presumptions emerge even within the new galaxy. however, the game’s attempt to recognize the insidious nature of implicit bias nevertheless participates in a colonial praxis in which the player is actively encouraged to treat andromeda’s indigenous peoples as either enemies or innocents in need of salvation, contradicting the game’s attempt to advocate for tolerance  
and multiculturalism.

fantasy in slash fan fiction
 ■kristina busse, university of south alabama
 ■alexis lothian, university of maryland,

slash fan fiction depicts same-sex 
erotic relationships among figures from popular media. working with romance tropes, its representations often reproduce the heteronormativity and whiteness of dominant media cultures. yet the tropes and networks of slash also provide a canvas for queer world-making on which queer, feminist, antiracist creators radically reimagine the operation of gender, race, and sexuality. this paper will explore how a radical vision of justice is developed in the novel-length fan fiction known associates by thingswithwings, which reimagines the marvel comics character captain america through an engagement with feminist, queer, trans, and radical social movement history.
the waterbending master’: the au as 
revolutionary project
 ■regina yung lee, university of washingtonthis paper argues for a particular 
fan fiction genre, the au (alternative universe), as a speculative methodology enacting the transformative justice required for a possible future in which indigenous women are no longer debarred from self-determination or structural social innovation. through my case study of fic which rearticulates a central tenet of avatar: the last airbender, i argue that this method’s actualization lies in the deviation between canonical and fandom texts. this fic’s radical speculative power lies in the case study’s explicit movement beyond compliance, reclamation, or reaction, toward a politicized, transformative intertextual response.
speculative queerness: imagining  
alternative togetherness in east asia
 ■casey lee, swarthmore college
i consider the feverish cross-cultural 
reception of two women-oriented works that inexplicitly deal with themes of queer love. the 1963 hong kong film the love eterne makes use of cross-dressing to affect multiple layers of gender performance, thrilling chinese-speaking audiences worldwide. the 2016 figure skating anime yuri on ice follows the highly publicized intimacy between two male figure skaters during competition, eliciting charges of queerbaiting from mostly western fans. i look at the contextual significance of shifts in fan responses and explain how the works’ seeming latent queerness actually expresses future-oriented yearnings.

the list: a postsecular feminist view ■nandini deo, lehigh university
the debate over the list created by 
sarkar and its criticism by eminent feminists in india led by menon has opened up a number of fruitful conversations about indian feminism. i am interested in examining the debate from a postsecular feminist perspective. postsecular feminism foregrounds context and power relations in making normative sense of such controversies. it highlights the ways secularist assumptions by many feminists can problematically paper over relevant differences in experiences. it can also offer a useful way of thinking about restorative justice as an alternative to carceral or due process based legal remedies to sexual harassment.
hong kong’s brown v. board of education

 ■puja kapai, the university of hong kong
as countries around the world 
experience their own brown v. board of education moment, it is pertinent to examine the legacy of the united states supreme court’s decision and the lived realities of african american children. using hong kong as a case study, i draw on critical race theory and intersectionality to reassess the arguments made in brown to demonstrate why desegregation fails abysmally as a guarantee for educational equality. i argue that an intersectional framing is indispensable to achieving equity in education given the systemically entrenched disparities which undermine equality of access and opportunities for particular groups.

teaching the reproductive justice walking tour
 ■jennifer musial, new jersey city university
my reproductive justice course asks students to teach their academic research to the general public. couched in the institutional language of “civic engagement”, the reproductive justice walking tour (inspired by the 2014 nyc tour organized by words for choice) is a radical peer and community education praxis that maps the built environment through reproductive oppression. acting as public intellectuals, students break the town/gown distinction that continues to define the academy. moreover, by sharing their research with the public and learning from community members in return, students re-imagine what knowledge production looks like.”

this paper, based on personal

queering gender: resignification of  
“third sex” by japanese feminists
 ■julia bullock, emory university
the japanese term daisan no sei [“third 
sex”] was conventionally used in the early postwar period to refer to male homosexuals. but beginning in the 1950s, japanese women began to appropriate this term for feminist purposes, resignifying it to imagine diverse possibilities for liberation from conventional gender discourses and roles. in this paper i adopt mark mclelland’s methodology for a foucaultian-inspired genealogical excavation of daisan no sei within the japanese context, acknowledging its debt to western theoretical categories yet highlighting japanese women’s creative engagement with the term,  
 in order to trace the implications of  
this resignification for japanese  
feminist theory.
queer lala in china: radical justice and/or

 ■dian dian, emory university
first appearing in the chinese online

queering transgenderism in southwest china ■shunyuan zhang, trinity college
based on an eighteen-month ethnographic research in southwest china among male-to-female transgendered individuals, this paper discusses how my informants’ lived experiences troubled the analytic/political opposition between straight and queer in mainstream queer theorization. methodologically, it explores alternative possibility of queer theorization through an attention to the everyday life that does not take anti-normativity as its point of departure. epistemologically, it draws inspiration from butler’s gender performativity and foucault’s genealogical approach; on the basis of which, it seeks to engage in conversation with the critical re-examination of the utopianization of queer politics/analytics and to imagine “what’s next then” after de-exceptionalizing queer.

unlike modern kantian approaches to justice, jane addams imagines justice in the context of inequality. her experiential accounts of collaborative friendships developed among the diverse immigrant groups surrounding chicago’s hull house settlement situate justice in a feminist relational context that incorporates gender, class, ethnicity, and race. in today’s world of rampant inequality, addams’s vision of justice is a major improvement over visions that associate justice with democratic relations, for example among democratic citizens, and neglect the need for justice in unequal relations. i examine addams accounts to outline her vision of justice and the process for achieving it.
the ambivalence of revolutionary cleaning in 
mona prince’s my name is revolution
 ■nada ayad, fashion institute of technology
in egyptian writer mona prince’s memoir 
revolution is my name, she narrates the cleaning of tahrir square, the sight of the 201 1 revolution. through close reading of key passages of the text, i argue that prince brings women’s domestic roles – roles that have been historically seen as lagging behind concepts of progress or change – into the very moment of revolution, while raising the specter  
of colonialism.

who is the bloodchild?: octavia butler’s vision 
of a space-time beyond the human as man
 ■lou cornum, city university of new york
octavia butler’s stories of contact 
between humans and aliens become stories of transformation--in her vision of the future as told in the short story bloodchild, humans cannot remain as they are if they are to survive. i consider this transformation alongside the project of sylvia wynter, who calls for unsettling the coloniality of being that overdetermines humanity as the enlightenment conception of man. this paper reads bloodchild in a colonial context that refuses the inevitability of conquest and challenges us to consider the necessary transformations of inhabiting a new world that take humans beyond western conceptions of gender and personhood.
envisioning carceral counterfutures  
in ‘wolfpack’
 ■leilani dowell, city university of new york
utilizing sarah jane cevernak’s work on black philosophical wandering and katherine mckittrick’s demand for decolonial thinking in response to plantation futures, this paper analyses mecca jamilla sullivan’s short story “wolfpack.” in 2006 the new jersey four, a group of black lesbian and gender nonconforming friends, were convicted for defending themselves against an attack. in sullivan’s fictionalized version of the event, “wolfpack” character verneice tells us, upon her imprisonment, that “this is when i decide to make things whatever i want them to be” – a queer black call for the imagining of counterfutures as a mode of survival and resistance.

how can we, as instructors, encourage

(a third university is possible xiii). these questions frame our roundtable in which we illustrate the use of a decolonial, black feminist lens at four different institutions. from teaching to programming within identity centers to faculty-staff development, we argue that diversity (alone) cannot get us to decolonizing black feminist futures.

anastasia todd, university of kentucky
 ■heather switzer, arizona state university
this paper performs a critical reading 
of the 2017 documentary “unrest,” which foregrounds stories of people with chronic fatigue syndrome who are “forgotten” by medical institutions. we engage feminist disability studies and affect theory to investigate the affective dimensionality of invisible disability as slow death. we interrogate how gendered ableism functions to maintain rigid boundaries between ability and disability. ultimately, this paper forwards the political potentiality of crip hope and hopelessness as a dialectical formation that works to affectively reorient disability futures.
an affective reorientation of disability and 
carcerality: re-thinking transformative justice
 ■viki peer, arizona state university
this paper interrogates the murders of 
basma rafay and samantha marcus, two disabled women of color. i use affect theory and intersectional feminist theory to consider how the u.s. criminal justice system functions to dehumanize rafay and marcus through ableist, racist logics that produce these two women as exceptional disabled women of color, but only in death. i explore how these two murders effectively and affectively shore up the carceral state as a legitimate force of justice. i ultimately ask, can the carceral state ever produce a radical vision of disability justice?

caribbean protagonists who have abortions because they are afraid their children may be born with disabilities. just as these two characters are made to feel wrong about their pregnancies because of their own racial, sexual, and bodily difference, affective biopolitics constrains reproductive choices for women who undergo prenatal screening for disabilities based on intersecting feelings of ableism, racism, and heteronormativity.
beverly jenkins and the possibilities and

 ■gabriella onikoro-arkell, arizona  
state university
this paper examines the works of 
romance author beverly jenkins and interviews with her from the documentary “love between the covers” in order to understand how black romance novels imagine a different past and future for black women and the limitations of that imagining. as part of their dehumanization, black women are understood as unlovable and receive a lack of care and emotional labor all while being expected to do an overabundance of this kind of work for others. i explore the limits and possibilities of jenkin’s novels as a tool for black women to compensate for this deficit.
155. presidential session: 
repression, resistance and solidarity: black panthers to black lives matter and palestine to standing rock
11:00am - 12:15pm
room 204-205 (lcd)
this session will look at the intricate 
nexus between state repression in the form of cointelpro, harassment of pro palestine activists, censorship of campus anti-racist activists, and the violence suppression of the movements against settler colonialism from what is now the united states to palestine. repression never occurs without a response and it is in fact often a reaction to the growing strength of opposition and revolutionary movements. in this context solidarity is vital; from the cubans and algerians who gave safe haven to u.s. political exiles to those who stood with indigenous folk at alcatraz, wounded knee and standing rock. the current attacks on black freedom activists in the form of the fbi’s “black identity extremists” adds another layer that will be discussed. college campuses have been one important site of repression, resistance and solidarity: from mills college and san francisco state in the 1960s to the harassment of progressive and radical professors today and responses to it. this panel will wrestle with these important themes from their experiences in the u.s., london and around the globe.

the theoretical moorings of this 
presentation are predicted on the belief that the everydayness of life under occupation is where we can understand the bio-politics of israeli occupation as one layer of settler colonialism (appadurai, 2006; bauman 2003). centralizing the lives of women living in gaza exposes the impact of biopolitical structures and patriarchal power, particularly on pregnancy outcomes and thus moves not only towards understanding how zionist settler occupation represents a population/gender/national security nexus in the arena of conflict but also how this nexus poses a serious threat to the advancement of reproductive  justice internationally.

drawing from intersectional queer, 
postcolonial feminisms, this essay critiques the pepfar and usaid-funded “super girl” hiv prevention campaign, first implemented in côte d’ivoire in 2009, and the 2016 ivorian constitution. by interrogating how hiv prevention campaigns and the 2016 constitution dovetail to affirm heteronormative family and sexualities as foundational to personhood, this paper responds to nwsa’s call to trouble notions of the human defined against those excluded and queered as non-human.
israel’s still-born: race, reproduction  
and power in israel and palestine
 ■bayan abusneineh, university of california, 
san diego
this paper contextualizes the coerced 
sterilizations of ethiopian jewish women in israel to argue that the zionist settler colonial project is not only anti-black, but predicated on the management and targeting of women’s bodies and sexualities, including indigenous palestinian women. a turn to coerced sterilizations of ethiopian women reveals how the necropolitical and biopolitical nature of the zionist project is obsessed with constructing the white (re: human) sovereign israeli subject. this turn disrupts the native/settler binary often constructed within settler colonial discourse, which allows for a re-theorizing of zionist settler colonialism alongside anti-blackness, making the black-palestinian solidarity movement more urgent.

2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: friday, november 9 ■lori rudolph, new mexico highlands 
university
when palestinian women encountered 
the lethality that characterizes political violence, survival became their primary concern and resistance became the project of staying alive. palestinian mothers are positioned as the primary caretakers and protectors of their husbands and children. while these roles are indeed circumscribed by culturally ascribed gender roles, the national liberation struggle at the same time created spaces and possibilities for other paths and journeys. this presentation will illustrate how palestinian mothers used their homes as sites of resistance to support individual and collective perseverance within and struggle against political violence.

on becoming the problem you were meant 
to solve: faculty development, critical race education, and the politics of resistance.
 ■whitney a. peoples, university of michigan
sara ahmed (2012) has argued that 
“describing the problem of racism can mean being treated as if you have created the problem, as if the very talk of divisions is what is divisive” (p.152). if ahmed is correct in her assertion, how does one go about talking and teaching about structural racism when naming the issue as such is imagined as being as harmful as racism itself. this paper explores the work of faculty development around critical race education and anti-racism and navigating the challenge and possibility of institutional and individual engagement and resistance.
making faculty development labor  
visible and valuable ■stephanie moody, university of michigan
bernhagen and gravett (2017) 
characterize educational development as “pink collar labor” because it is disproportionately carried out by women and reproduces feminized discourses (9). this paper further contributes to this conversation by focusing, not on the faculty developers, but on the instructors who participate in faculty development programming. the results of four focus groups of contingent instructors demonstrate an ongoing challenge: while the university offers important opportunities to participate in faculty development, these opportunities are often unpaid and undervalued. using discourse analysis, i examine instructors’ talk about participating in faculty development work and consider how universities might incentivize  faculty development.

as transitional/convergent spaces, 
community colleges are borderlands, as gloria anzaldúa theorized, operating as an “unnatural boundary…una herida abierta, where the third world grates against the first and bleeds” (anzaldúa 25). rendered invisible by hierarchies in “higher” education, our cc classrooms bear witness to students’ embodied and inherently intersectional feminisms. their voices should penetrate and inform academic feminism, yet they study against the unnatural boundaries where community colleges and universities bleed. re-visioning transformative pedagogies in/from/for the cc borderlands could serve instead as models for vibrant feminist praxis and productive alliance.

“student engagement”
 ■heather rellihan, anne arundel  
community college
this paper analyzes the effects of the 
neoliberal paradigm on the ability to cultivate inclusive civic engagement, and discusses models for teaching activism as an insurgent practice. the focus on skills-based instruction and a return to what paolo freire calls “the banking concept of education” devalues un-quantifiable learning outcomes like empathy and civic engagement, foundations of wgs. i argue that wgs should embrace its marginal space to reassert a radical vision of education grounded in radical interconnectedness (anzaldúa), unpacking dominator culture (hooks), valuing empathy, and empowering students to see themselves as active citizens with political efficacy.
insurgence through art
 ■suzanne spoor, anne arundel  
community college
when students create plates, goblets 
and a menu for sister settings, an art installation piece modeled on judy chicago’s dinner party, they challenge neoliberal models of education, for they seek fugitive knowledge about women, continue georgia o’keeffe’s revolutionary practice of centering design on labia, and dare to exhibit in the fiercely de-politicized space of the community college dining hall. further radicalizing the work, students in communications and humanities classes collaborate with those in art. as pressure to institutionalize ways of knowing increases, it is insurgence to create interdisciplinary alliances and assess “non-art” students through  artistic creations.

and without the academy.

complexities of trans in/visibility “as an important axiom on which we come to know ourselves and […] our 120
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: friday, november 9community” (p. 17). at the “transgender 
tipping point” (steinmetz, 2014), what does trans in/visibility mean in higher education and student affairs? furthermore, what might it reveal about higher education’s maintenance of dominance through inclusion (ahmed, 2012)? using critical autoethnography (boylorn & orbe, 2016), this paper engages the trappings of trans representation in hesa, scrutinizing access points and limits of non-cooperation (gossett, stanley, & burton, 2017), as a reflexive process of holding self and discipline accountable to liberatory values.
‘centering’ a trans* episteme: a strategy 
for advancing women’s and gender centers’ liberatory praxis
 ■susan marine, merrimack college
for the last four decades, feminist praxis 
in higher education has located the ongoing work of gender empowerment in college and university women’s and gender centers (cottledge, et al. forthcming; davie, 2002). nicolazzo’s (2017) trans* epistemology expands upon this praxis: centering of an historically invisible subject, conscious commitment to naming and destabilizing relations of dominance, and drawing on lived experience as data. this paper explores application of nicolazzo’s theory to the optimal functioning of women’s and gender centers in higher education, inviting “thinking beyond and across bodies, positionalities, subjects, and affects” (nicolazzo, 2017 , p. 21) to advance greater human flourishing.
ivory tower ignorance: trans(*) knowledge 
and organizations as adjuncts of the academy
 ■alden jones, university of texas at austin
in recent years, research about 
transgender college students, faculty, and staff has become prevalent (renn, 2010; beemyn & rankin, 2012). specific recommendations for the inclusion of trans* women of color who show up less frequently, if at all, in current research in higher education remains scarce. this paper uses nicolazzo’s (2017) “trans* epistemologies” to consider ways the academy will always, already fail to meet the needs of trans* constituents at all levels, but especially trans* women of color. then, this paper will explicate ways the academy might learn from trans* ways of knowing inherent in trans* led and focused organizations.
beyond capes and spandex: liberatory trans* 
imaginings of comics and the academy
 ■nick thuot, iowa state university
in contemporary social justice 
discourse, energy has primarily gone toward “working against-working to stop, to end, to dismantle, to disrupt, to interrupt, to shut up, and to close down” systems of oppression (love, dejong & hughbanks 2007). while vital to our liberation, imagining of our future society has largely been ignored. building from nicolazzo’s (2017) call for a trans* epistemology, this paper will discuss ways trans* representation and readership in comic books (saga, 2012; kim & kim 2017) proliferates liberatory possibilities and alternative ways of knowing that center trans* people as vital sources of previously unrecognized knowledge in the academy.

this roundtable explores how the 2017

wave feminism.

make space for ace: examining the needs

 ■heather prost, simon fraser university
feminist and queer spaces of trauma-
healing tend to encourage sex and sex positivity as part of the process of identity rediscovery and unpacking trauma. whenever sex is centred in healing frameworks, divisions may form in who feels comfortable accessing services.this paper argues that sexualized violence affects asexual-identified individuals differently and explores the complexities asexual survivors navigate during their healing. trauma study must be intersectional, specifically with regard to racialization, indigeneity, ability, and gender. this paper questions compulsory sexuality and uses audre lorde’s concepts of the erotic to explore (re)claiming the non-sexual during the healing path of survivors.
slowly turning to grit”: stone butch 
asexualities and non-human intimacies
 ■cynthia barounis, washington university  
in st. louis
this paper explores stone butch 
untouchability as a variation on asexuality through readings of eli clare’s memoirs. while clare never explicitly identifies as asexual in his autobiographical writing, there are strong “asexual resonances” (przybylo and cooper 2014) in clare’s negotiation of his stone butch identity as it intertwines with his transness, his disability, and his experience as a survivor of trauma. from the textures of stones to the surfaces of shells, clare literalizes stone butch orientation as an intimate encounter with the natural world that complicates the distinctions between human and non-human, sensation and numbness, coping  
and cure.
asexy non-humans: the intersections of

this paper explores representations 
of the intersections of a/sexuality and artificial intelligence in contemporary film. using a comparative approach, this critical analysis examines a/sexuality in the non-human from a variety of cultural contexts: robot (india, 2010), her (us, 2013), ex machina (uk, 2015), and chappie (south africa, 2015). i argue that the four futuristic movies represent the non-human characters as predominantly asexual. these representations allow us to rethink normativity in the context of gender and sexuality. they also expand our understanding of what is means to be non/human.

 ■abiola mustapha, university of arizona
the persistence of black women 
within predominately white universities showcase how they have been prominent influential leaders, activists, and advocates for equal rights in the united states (howard, 1989). black women attending college in the 1800’s was transformative in that it shifted notions of assumed in competencies of women of color. this paper creates and provides counter narratives through a recounting of the experiences of black women scholars. it also provides a powerful understanding of how black women thrive despite the racialized and gender biased reactions that they are often dealt within institutions of higher learning.

tactics and strategies of 30 black movement actors, ages 18-40 years old from september to december 2016, in the district of columbia and maryland in the united states. by using a historical materialist and intersectional theoretical conceptualization, black women movement actors’ narratives are highlighted to evaluate the potential for a broader based social movement.
167. feminist technoscience matters

science & technology task force122
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: friday, november 911:00am - 12:15pm
room 220
this panel addresses how feminist 
technoscience inquires after alternative futures of technoscience and market economies. examining the making of pharmaceutical drugs in south africa and the design of smart cities, this second part of a two-part panel series asks how feminist technoscience can fabulate more nuanced understandings of the body as well as socio-technical 
characters of future cities.
human-plant relations and reimagining 
feminist technoscience futures
 ■laura foster, indiana university bloomington
through feminist, indigenous, 
and decolonial sts insights, this paper examines a succulent plant to understand forces of patent ownership, indigenous san peoples’ knowledge, contractual benefit sharing, pharmaceutical research, herbal supplement markets, and bioprospecting legislation in south africa. specifically, it examines how the various materialities of a succulent plant interrupt the very forces of law, science, and market that seek to contain it. in doing so, it asks how an emphasis on human-plant relations can provide insights that support san efforts towards self-determination, rethink feminist new materialisms, and reimagine better ways of doing science and law.
reimagining cyborg feminism in a 
postcolonial synthetic chemistry lab
 ■anne pollock, king’s college london
this paper combines empirical 
ethnographic attention to a specific site of postcolonial science - a small south african drug discovery company - and theoretically-driven feminist analysis attentive to technoscientific materialities. the emergent properties of chemicals themselves provide evocative analogues to aspirations of scientists in this “emerging economy,” even as the chemicals’ alterity resists romanticization. unlike drug discovery efforts based on bioprospecting, place in synthetic chemistry signifies less autochthony or authenticity than co-presence. moreover, since the term “synthetic” is often used as an antonym for “natural,” a postcolonial synthetic chemistry lab is a fitting site for elaboration of a cyborg feminism.
reimagining cities: feminist alternatives to 
the smart
 ■nassim jafarinaimi, georgia tech
can feminist theories be grounds for 
rethinking smart cities? technology-centered and industry-driven, dominant discourses around smart cities evoke images of a techno-utopic city: where traffic flows efficiently; data from an ever-expanding array of sensors support “smart” decisions; or high-resolution cameras and gunshot detection technologies ensure safety. however, the world conjured in such imagery is far from feminist. tidiness, efficiency, and control are not feminist ideals. surveillance is not the panacea for safety. in this paper, i position the smart city as an urgent site for both practical feminist intervention and feminist theorizing that otherwise imagines the relationships between technologies, cities.

a future beyond death: black women’s 
autobiography in the era of black lives matter
 ■stacie mccormick, texas christian university
thinking with the critical framework of 
subtheme six, “political, cultural and artistic movements that ‘demand the impossible:’ ‘abolition’ and beyond,”  this paper considers two memoirs, lezley mcspadden’s tell the truth, shame the devil and danielle allen’s cuz and their participation in a tradition of black women’s autobiographical writing that has historically theorized about and worked to upend social structures enabling black death. correspondingly, this paper explores the relation between mourning and futurity that emerges where both writers counter state violence meant to foreclose black life with a reframing of these deaths as catalysts for social transformation.
dis-orientation: muslim arab american 
women deconstruct gendered racialization
 ■alexandra magearu, university of california, 
santa barbara
this paper builds on the feminist 
postcolonial scholarship on existential disorientation and exclusionary space (ahmed 2004; 2006), the racializing gaze of islamophobia (al-saji 2010) and phenomenologies of racialization (alcoff 2006) in order to analyze the relational and co-constitutive processes of gendered racialization specific to islamophobia. to do so, i foreground the poetic and artistic strategies of muslim arab american activists, writers and artists such as amani al-khatahtbeh, mona haydar and mohja kahf, employed to deconstruct orientalist and islamophobic stereotypes, dis-orient white xenophobic subjectivity and hegemonic imperialist space, and imagine new vocabularies of expression affirmative of complex cultural and diasporic identities.
mobilizing dalit women’s literary tradition 
as critical theories of women’s labor
 ■poonam argade, syracuse university
dalit women’s literary tradition, 
particularly auto/biographical writings, represent theoretical critiques of caste, class and gender oppression. through this paper, i explore the radical potential of dalit feminists’ and women’s writings, particularly, focusing on the links between labor, gender and caste that emerge through a reading of selected writings. i center these accounts of lived experiences, particularly on caste-based labor and i read these along with other south asian feminist theories of labor. through this process, i contribute to an anti-caste feminist framing of women’s labor and uncover new possibilities of engaging this radical literary tradition.
“reclaiming the body: reimagining women 
against feminicides in mexico”123
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: friday, november 9 ■diana aldrete, trinity college
along with subtheme six, “…artistic 
movements that ‘demand the impossible’,” this paper considers how literary texts construct ways to properly represent victims of feminicides in mexico. this paper argues that some literature on the feminicides have emphasized the need for the written (re)presentation of women to not only be re-humanized, but contest ways women are marginalized and violated. furthermore, these literary texts assist in presenting a political narrative that challenges the dominant discourse on female victims.
archiving the moment: searching for  
 radical feminist futures in the crunk 
feminist collection
 ■hazel gedikli, university of  
massachusetts amherst
engaging in the subtheme one, this 
paper examines the crunk feminist collective’s recent publication the crunk feminist collection (2017). i read the collection along with toni morrison’s beloved (1987), alice walker’s the color purple (1982), focusing on their shared and diverse black feminist visions. patricia hills collins work on black feminist epistemology will be a guiding theory for my examination; however, all types and genres of feminist writings and knowledge productions, which constitute the archive of this paper, carry equal weight for my purpose of engaging the black feminist visions of the twenty-first century.
169. strange bedfellows: lgbtq and 
feminist studies programs in  queer times
11:00am - 12:15pm
room 222
in 1994, judith butler warned against 
the fissure between gender as the “proper object” of women’s studies as a field of critical inquiry and sex/sexuality as the “proper object” of lesbian and gay studies. nevertheless, an increasing number of diverse undergraduate institutions continue to offer/are developing minors and majors in lgbt and/or queer studies, independently and within women’s/feminist studies programs. this roundtable explores what this growing interest in lgbtq program development and curriculum design signals in a context of austerity and intensifying competition for students in higher education today, while interrogating the relationships between lgbtq and women’s studies.

 ■khadijah olivia miller, norfolk

michelle obama serves as a model 
of the importance of knowing one’s history. her pervasiveness in fighting for healthy lives speaks to the basic tenants of colored women’s clubs created in the late 19th century. her community garden, addressing food deserts and encouraging healthy eating and movement provides a familiar historical prototype of change, freedom, autonomy and social justice. all that michelle obama did speaks to what race women did in the past pushing for empowerment, self-definition and sufficiency. she didn’t just encourage folks to eat vegetables and hula hoop, but rather provided a vision of change.
black women, hip hop and social justice: a 
psychological perspective
 ■erica r. russell, norfolk state university
the hip hop industry is more than 
beats and rhymes. hip hop provides us with pervasive psychological avenues of actions that can be positive and negative. black women participate in hip hop. black women are often the focus of hip hop and black women create hip hop. what is the psychological impact? can hip hop serve as a activist tool? can hip hop provide a vision of change, hop, autonomy and freedom for black women? this paper seeks to address these questions and more from a psychological perspective.

embodying intersections: the black lesbian-
feminist performance poetry of staceyann chin
 ■kristyl dawn tift, kennesaw state university
in this paper, i analyze the black lesbian 
feminist performance (blfp) poetry of staceyann chin. i explore chin’s poem “cross–fire” for evidence of the complexities of “homemaking” for transnational lesbian-feminist artists like herself. chin, who is jamaican-chinese american, not only illustrates multiple aspects of intersectional identity in her work, but she proposes interventions to the discomfort that arise when she articulates her identity in public spaces, like the broadway stage. relying on feminist, queer-of-color, and performance theories, i argue that chin contributes to a genre of performance invested in utopian outcomes through revelations of and reconciliations with traumatic pasts.

virtual encounters
 ■michelle lee, university of minnesota
focusing on the augmented reality (ar) 
and virtual reality (vr) installation works by tamiko thiel, zara houshmand, and artist group lily & honglei, i argue that they collectively create an embodiment of what i call transnational cyber feminism. in this way, these artists within the asian diaspora locate themselves as ghastly entities within the u.s. to envision their in/abilities of occupying a homeland. i explore the bodily, spatial, and socio-political transgressions provided by ar and vr and critique the ways in which they invoke historical trauma, narratives of displacement, and the multiple orientalist gazes particular to the formation of asian/america.

 ■breanne fahs, arizona state universitywomen’s studies as a field emerged as 
the “academic wing” of the women’s liberation movement; as such, at its inception, activism played a central role in the development of the field. this paper examines the perils and pleasures of teaching activist assignments to students, showcasing some of their interventions, university and bureaucratic responses, and highlighting the necessity of nurturing radical feminist scholar/activist identities (particularly in the trump era). implications for teaching tools of resistance, designing courses about social movements and activism, and reimagining the pedagogical priorities of women and gender studies are included.

madness, justice, protest127
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: friday, november 9 ■t. christine jespersen, western state 
colorado university
while contemporary women’s literary 
fiction raises crucial issues such as sexual and gendered violence, histories of colonization, environmental destruction, and neoliberal market deification, their mostly postmodern endings rarely offer unambiguous possibility. based upon assumptions of possibility, feminist pedagogy emphasizes liberatory objectives of social change (freire and hooks), combined with intersectional perspectives of the subject (crenshaw and collins) and the validation of personal experience (anzaldúa and moraga). this paper details a madness, justice, protest project underpinned by feminist pedagogy and literature’s potential to imagine other worlds. students transform maddening class material into personal-political projects of hope.
radical voices in a reactive time
 ■april lidinsky, indiana university south bend
while the #metoo movement and other reactive rhetorics have carved some kinds of feminist progress, writers like susan faludi and sara ahmed warn that these small successes might detract from the longer-view unglamorous work of undoing the patriarchy and fundamentally rebuilding culture. this paper examines the teaching of radical feminist manifestos, critiquing and re-imagining calls to action for the current landscape. drawing on the redstockings, radicalesbians, solanas, freeman, bunch, morgan, and others, students infuse these insights with more contemporary approaches, using intersectional, queer, and global perspectives. public performance  and concepts of protest are part of  the experience.

embodied assemblages:transgender  
male pregnancy
 ■muge yuce, georgia state university
transgender male pregnancy becomes 
the field of assemblages by displacing the ontological binary oppositions (male/female). by using his female reproductive organs, transgender male constitutes assemblages of multiple singularities and manifests what a body can do apart from its genitalized organization. by reading a video of thomas beattie, “the pregnant man”, i argue that this embodied assemblage explains his abjection and his becoming a voyeuristic image within society. deleuze & guattari’s ‘bodies without organs’ (1972) makes it possible to discuss what a body can do beyond the hierarchical binary gender system, as a cure for the exclusionary reactions against transgender pregnancy.

 ■penny harvey, georgia state university
in the arena of sex research, we know 
that sexual interactions are often fraught with power dynamics, issues of communication and questions of consent. i conducted online qualitative questionnaires asking people from a broad range of gender identities about their sexual experiences. in this questionnaire i asked, “in a perfect world what would sexual interactions look like to you?” this question could be interpreted in a variety of ways and was. this paper seeks to explore the narratives of participants who identified as trans or genderqueer and how they foresaw their ideal sexual interaction.
barriers to motherhood: biotechnology, 
reproductive justice, and transgender women
 ■alexandra marilyn chace, georgia  
state university
reproductive activism has typically 
focused on abortion and pregnancy over other concerns, thereby centering white cisgender women and (increasingly) transgender men. even trans-inclusive discourse has paid relatively little attention to the reproductive needs and possibilities of transgender women, particularly trans women of color. accordingly, this paper analyzes how medicalized discourses, unequal access to healthcare, and cissexism intersect to discursively, medically, and legally deny motherhood to transgender women. furthermore, it envisions contested futures where biotechnologies and reproductive trans bodies trouble “the coherence of a narrative that is already fragile” while potentially perpetuating existing inequities (strangio 2015: 235).

racialized disgender: caring about the body 
beyond the binary
 ■milo obourn, the college at brockport
this paper looks at intersections of race, 
gender and disability in the work of audre lorde and miriam engelberg, reading gender as always already deconstructing the binary that produces it by existing not only across instantiations in biology, performance, identity, and expression, but also as articulated intersectionally with race and ability status. i use these readings to present exercises that help participants articulate beyond the gender binary using existing knowledge about “racialized disgender,” i.e. the interdependence between social constructions of and cultural discourses about gender and race, and social constructions of and cultural discourses about illness, health, disability,  
and able-bodiedness.
“a weird sorta purgatory”: expanding 
approaches to inclusion for non-binary college students”
 ■angela clark-taylor, bowling green  
state university
this paper presents findings of a 
phenomenological study of non-binary students’ experiences in college. focusing on how non-binary students make meaning of their identity and experience in college, findings suggest that though supportive programing and policy are of importance and must continue on college campuses, they did not pose as great a threat to non-binary students belonging and well-being as their interpersonal and institutional relationships. the implication of these findings is that for true university inclusion we need a deeper and more substantial understanding of non-binary identity at the individual and institutional level.

(lgbq+) young adults desire wellness (hoffman et al. 2009), yet mainstream resources predominantly highlight lgbq+-related risks (russell 2005). racial/ethnic identities also shape sexual risk discourses, particularly for young latina women who encounter heteronormative, racist societal messages (garcia 2009). while latina college students face stereotypically gendered and sexual expectations (sy and romero 2008), less is known about how multiply marginalized college students manage risk discourses. through qualitative interviews with 30 lgbq+ latina college students in the rio grande valley, i intersectionally examine how they navigate dominant societal messages of risk surrounding their sexual and reproductive health.
(re)framing the social organization of black 
girls in all-girl gangs and all-girl peer groups as resistance
 ■brittney miles, university of cincinnati
the ways middle and high school-
aged black girls organize themselves in all-girl gangs and peer groups serves as a platform for expanding our understandings of their everyday resistance strategies. schools and communities readily readily reject black girls’ strengths, and black girls actively counter this rejection. girls create new ways of knowing about themselves and the world through relationships. identifying these groups as a team that are codependent working towards shared goals, this project uses erving goffman’s framework for dramaturgical conceptions of a team. these girls work to change their locus in the world and the way the world engages them.
“the post-ferguson effect”: teaching against 
(and alongside) systemic racism129
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: friday, november 9 ■kelly christina sharron, university of arizona
the question of how to meaningfully 
address ferguson and police brutality has been part of a few crowdsourced projects including #fergusonsyllabus and the online digital archive, documenting ferguson, among others. noticeably absent from the crowdsourced #fergusonsyllabus is a discussion of intersectionality as critical to framing police and/or state violence. this paper argues that in the wake of ferguson, and in the project of teaching ferguson, intersectionality is an insufficient framework that all to easily fails to signal the histories and legacies of racism in state practice and fails to inspire student activism in the face of neoliberal niceties.
triple outsider: experiencing black 
motherhood in grad school at a pwi.
 ■deniece dortch, george  
washington university
this critical phenomenological study 
explores one single black cisgender woman mother and her sense of belonging in doctoral studies at a pwi in the midwest. authors utilized black feminist thought, and sense of belonging to frame the study. data was drawn from three 90-minute semi-structured interviews over one academic year. findings suggest that assata’s experiences were shaped by triple consciousness, as well as respectability politics from faculty and peers and how she negotiated the complexities of her multiple identities while pursuing a doctorate. implications for faculty considerations, graduate programs,  and higher education are discussed.

how are we propelled toward a more

*the best we could do* by thi bui 
is a nationally recognized “refugee” graphic memoir that asks its readers to participate in a visual (re)image-ing of the american war in vietnam. however, the hegemony of the war and refugee narrative dominates the text’s critical analyses leaving little room a gender critique. my paper will read bui’s graphic memoir against g.b. tran’s *vietnamerica*-a similarly popularized vietnamese american graphic memoir-to look at visualization of sex, gender, and sexuality in war graphic memoirs.  i argue that the author’s gender identity greatly shaped the dominant visual imagination and memories of the war and imperialism.

 ■cheryl llewellyn, university of

while the u.s. increasingly restricts 
access to its borders in the name of national security, the number of refugees from the middle east also increases with growing instability in the region. in this paper, we analyze news coverage of the “refugee crisis” from 2015 and 2016. using an inductive content analysis, we identify four dominant gendered narratives in the data, including refugees as: threats, burdens, victims, and humans. we argue that these narratives are strategically employed in debates about immigration specifically and global politics generally and lead to framing of refugees as less than human in public discourse.

the 1990s in canada were marked by 
neoliberal campaigns that stigmatized welfare recipients. elected officials and media suggested that welfare fraud was rampant, and welfare recipients needed to be surveilled. at the same time, fears of “bogus” refugees with no documentation dominated public discourse (razack, 2000). by the mid-1990s, the figure of the “bogus” refugee and “welfare cheater” converged to produce the figure of a refugee defrauding welfare systems. somalis in canada bore the brunt of this discourse. this paper investigates the ways racist and gendered representations of somalis were used to animate 130

“reproducing the robot: automation and

 ■kalindi vora, university of california, davis
 ■neda atanasoski, university of california, 
santa cruz
a cheaply reproducible, or replacable, 
workforce has been a celebrated and feared outcome of increasing automation, even in the realm of what feminist scholars have termed “reproductive” labor. looking at domestic and sex robot prototypes, this paper revisits the scholarship on reproductive labor to think through the question: what does the imagined automation of domestic work and sex work, that is the labor of social reproduction and the labor of caring for biological bodies, mean when robots are reproducing the comfort and care in the home but are not themselves reproduced by that labor?
“the most obscene thing is working for a 
living”: porn workers on the future of work
 ■heather berg, university of

this paper explores workers’ narratives 
of labor in the porn industry as a means of refusing waged work in the “straight” (non-sex work) labor market. workers come to porn to avoid the crushing tedium of a 9-5 job, but find a work day that never really ends. their stories speak to marxist feminist concerns that the promise of un-alienated work might be used against us. navigating both hyper-commodification and unique opportunities for workers’ control, porn workers have much to tell us about what is wrong with work and how we might get to something beyond it.“work, family, and the crisis of social (re)
production: a feminist case for basic income”
 ■kathi weeks, duke university
this paper draws on the marxist feminist 
tradition to develop a critical account of the current problems with the two major systems of income allocation in the u.s.: waged work and family membership. i make a case for a basic income that would alleviate some of the pressures that constrain our options regarding waged work and family formation. as part of this argument, i make a new intervention into the feminist debate about whether a basic income would reinforce or upend the hetero-patriarchal gender division of labor that persists in shaping both the waged labor force and household political economy.

elaboration of a feminist materialism’s potential for expanding archives and practices of feminist sciences. by modifying “materialism” with feminist, and making it plural, rather than modifying “feminism” with materialist, i reconfigure the epistemic valences of materiality to invite invention, disunity, and new forms of accountability. the material consequences of the imperialist conflation of materialism and positivism demand a feminist materialist science studies committed to knowledge-politics and production as necessarily co-imbricated, and always implicated in larger worlding projects.
keywords: a project of feminist speculation
 ■durba mitra, harvard university
this paper is the seed of an aspirational project, a femglōssa, that lays bare the exclusionary history of keywords in fields of the social and natural sciences. i explore a set of nineteenth-century texts where india functioned as an empirical referent in the making of universalist theories of evolution. this project brings together feminist science with colonial studies and queer of color critique, which meditate on the inadequacies of foundational terms for the study of other bodies. how might we conceptualize feminist speculation outside of theories that saw the peoples of the colonial world as only intermittently endowed with humanity?
theorizing feminist tinkering with  
science methodologies
 ■sara giordano, university of california, davis
i use feminist, decolonial theories to 
define feminist tinkering as an explicitly politically motivated “playing” with the epistemic power of science. while play has become a central facet of the diy biology tinkerer movement, it has also figured prominently in feminist theorizing about methodologies and epistemologies. i draw specifically on lugones’ (1987) work on playfulness and world-traveling and bring it into conversation with deboleena roy’s (2012) proposal of a feminist science methodology of “feeling around” which she describes as a way to add “an element of playfulness” to patti lather’s (2012) methodology of “getting lost” (roy 2012, p. 17).

the call for this year’s conference in 
atlanta rightfully notes that w.e.b. dubois wrote many of his canonical works at atlanta university. equally important as a site of emergence is spelman college, founded in 1881 originally as the atlanta baptist female seminary. spelman has served as one of the foundational institutions of black female higher education, graduating many of the most pathbreaking african american women in u.s. history. it has also created the institutional space for fostering revolutionary black feminist thinking. 
this site visit to spelman college, 
sponsored by the committee on gender and sexuality studies (cgss), is also offered through the nwsa conference. the cgss has worked with dana pride jones, beverly guy sheftall, , holly smith, and patricia ventura, all of spelman college, to create an event that will include a visit to the spelman college archives, where holly smith will pull materials from the audre lorde and toni cade bambara collections to share with participants, and to the spelman museum, where the work of south african artist zanele muholi will be exhibited. the spelman museum is the only museum in the us emphasizing art by women of the african diaspora. 
participants should meet in the asa hotel 
lobby 45 minutes prior to the event (by 1:45) and will caravan there in taxis or lyfts. as individuals, participants can take marta, the atlanta rapid transit system, for $2.50 each way (from the ashby street station on the e/w line an .8 mile walk to the college), or drive on their own (parking fee of $3 per day in the spelman college parking deck) and meeting in the lobby of the camille olivia hanks cosby, edd, academic center at spelman college. if you drive, the correct gps address is 440 westview dr., sw, atlanta, georgia, 30310. for marta routes and schedules, visit: itsmarta.com. please contact amy farrell at farrell@dickinson.edu with any questions.moderator

through the lens of spirituality - specifically, the spiritual praxis of women of color. spiritual traditions and cultural memories of indigenous women, islamic women, other feminists and womanists of color imagine and create visions of spiritual activism challenging material and epistemological structures of colonization. we explore futures possible if spirituality were taken seriously as both ontoepistemology (anzaldúa 2015) and organizing methodology, e.g., emergent strategy (brown 2017). we explore spirituality as a central tenet of both theorizing and actualizing feminist futures that disrupts dominant narratives of the secular, challenges essentialism, and envisions radical and liberatory possibilities.133

this paper asks: what feminist 
futures might be imagined if we take spirituality seriously – not simply as an object of study, but as a foundational ontoepistemology for the theorization and creation of social change? drawing on the visionary work of gloria anzaldúa, and related work by feminist scholars (e.g., fernandes 2003, mani 2009, alexander 2006) and activists (e.g., adrienne maree brown, black lives matter, the movement strategy center) this paper will explore the rich, provocative, and mystical visions of spiritual activism already being imagined (and too often marginalized) by feminists of color, and creatively manifested in contemporary social movements.
imagining muslim women’s liberation 
beyond liberalism: what the tawhidi (unitary) weltanschauung exposes
 ■tabassum fahim ruby, west  
chester university
orientalist literature frequently depicts 
muslim women as victims of their “oppressive” religion and culture (kahf 1999; bernadette; 2007; abu-lughod 2013). within this trajectory, women’s liberation is frequently sought through liberal ideals—rights, freedom, and equality. yet, liberalism represents an anthropocentric concept and is contrary to a tawhidi worldview that characterizes theocentric. disregarding this difference and violently “saving” women by imposing a liberal conception of freedom demonstrates polymorphous techniques of subjugation (foucault 1980, 96). this paper reconstructs a discursive contrast between liberal and islamic formations to show how to mobilize and subvert dominant hegemonies and imagine women’s freedom beyond  colonial frameworksmemory as radical imaginary: indigenous

 ■shari valentine, henderson state university
from maori artists (kawiti, 2017) to

 ■samantha archer, university of connecticut
over the past decade, many science studies scholars have called for engagements with the natural sciences as sites for queer and feminist reinvention (wilson 2015, willey 2016, frost 2016). while there has been renewed interrogation of the material by feminist scholars (alaimo and hekman 2008), both the laboratory and laboratory practice have remained sites in need of queer and feminist reconfiguration. through several case studies, we demonstrate how we begin to reentangle that which was never really separate. in this paper, we map out the ways in which queer epistemologies can alter scientific knowledge production in and through the laboratory.

 ■suisui wang, indiana university
this paper interrogates chinese 
medical and mental health profession’s continued treatment of homosexuality. going beyond biomedical model and attentive to geopolitical situatedness, i find that the demedicalization debate in the 1990s was initially entangled in the cold-war anti-cultural-imperialism ideological landscape. furthermore, the lingering diagnostic category of “ego-dystonic homosexuality” works with the emerging therapeutic governance (yang 2015) to continuously privatize and channel queer desires into medical scrutiny and regulation. the ego-dystonic/syntonic binary in medical practice is further complicit with the homonormative visibility based on shame/pride, creating the selective negligence of continued medicalization and remedicalization among western media and domestic lgbt activists.

 ■shuzhen huang, bloomsburg university

this essay investigates how queer affect 
is invoked in order to foster a domestic queer market in mainland china. informed by ahmed’s (2004) notion of emotion as economic, i draw on hesford’s (2005) concept of affective identification and wingard’s (2013) notion of branding to reveal how queer bodies are mobilized, commodified, and branded in pink economy. situating chinese queer subjects in the geopolitics of transnational queer flows, i argue that the emerging pink economy is a complex site where queer emotions are exploited to create affective relationships between bodies before discursive cues work to trigger and guide the audience.
from “cock sucker” to “cool child”: what

 ■shana ye, university of toronto
the geopolitical landscape of post-

homonational taiwan and queer china? 
affective geopolitics and the question  of sovereignty ■wen liu, university at albany, suny
the framework of homonationalism 
conceptualizes queerness as a subjectivity that can be recruited by right-wing nationalist interests (puar, 2007). queerness, in many ways, has become a de facto anti-nation subjectivity. however, unlike white western queers who may afford to claim statelessness, racialized queers are bound to negotiate and encounter the issue of nation-states. in this paper, through an affective geopolitical perspective, i examine the entangled geopolitics between taiwan and china that has affected queer activist discourses in taiwan, where nationalism is not only a tactic of the elites but a melancholic longing and imagination for alternative queer futurity.

climate change, sex trafficking and the 
inclusion of environmental refugees within feminist discourse.
 ■shannon marie raczynski, manhattan college
climate change hinders women’s 
experience globally, yet these issues have been neglected within mainstream feminist discourse. climate change produces an influx of environmental refugees, resulting in a drastic acceleration of sex trafficking, with 90% of the trafficked victims being women. this has been under examined within mainstream feminism, due to the politics and power dynamics regarding refugees and sex trafficking. drawing on the work of feminist scholar nicole molinari, i argue that in order for ecofeminism to be integrated into western notions of feminism, proper political actions must be taken to aid environmental refugees and prevent sex trafficking transnationally.

security and the experience of indigenous

 ■august kissel, manhattan college
this paper examines how environmental 
injustice is intrinsically related to gender injustice, though ecofeminism has not been at the forefront of western feminist movements. in developing countries indigenous women are the primary natural resource managers. climate change puts constraints on food security and resources, affecting these women most significantly. with barren lands, women are forced to find new means of survival and are unable to further their education. based on the framework offered by feminist, emmanuel levinas, this paper argues that climate change  
is a feminist issue that requires both ethical and political attention from developed nations.

disproportionately impact marginalized populations; the forefront of the ecofeminist movement is predominantly marginalized women, whose efforts are not granted the same visibility as issues that concern mainstream white feminism. this paper employs an anti-colonial framework to position women of color at the forefront of the ecofeminism movement by examining the ways female environmental activists in flint and detroit, mi have shifted public consciousness of water into a human rights priority. utilizing the theories of karen j. warren, this paper protests that issues of intersectionality have prevented ecofeminism from entering mainstream western feminist discourse as a legitimate cause.
ecofeminism, veganism and intersectionality: 
combating minority marginalization and climate change.
 ■kehana elizabeth bonagura, the new school
within a patriarchal capitalist society, 
the parallels between the maltreatment of land and minority women by the food industry are alarming. the effects of the meat and dairy industry should be prioritized within vegan, intersectional feminism and ecofeminism movements alike, as environmentally deleterious meat and dairy farms are disproportionately situated in minority communities. based on a combination of media analyzes and literature reviews, this paper asserts that veganism, intersectionality and ecofeminism must be adopted into mainstream feminism to properly address how the meat and dairy industry contributes to climate change, as well  
as the institutional discrimination of minority communities.207. trans spatial practices --

 ■ren-yo hwang, mount holyoke college
using a critical participatory action 
research and transformative justice frame, this paper will investigate the difficulties of supporting (from outside) and sustaining (from inside) an advocacy group run by transgender women of color inside california state prison at corcoran. this paper will explore the transgressive abolitionist potential of mutual aid as both a methodological approach to action research, as well as unpacking its limits. further it will ask, how might research with those placed within trans*-designated carceral spaces necessitate the formation of long-term alliances, however unwieldy and without the foreseeable promises of ‘success ’ or good feelings?
tisha, rita, and mary lee

three black gender non-conforming femmes, tisha, rita, and mary lee, in 1950s print journalism to outline the contours of black trans feminist politics. beginning with a booking photograph of the trio, i use krista thompson’s concept of shine to outline the multiple vectors of power that circumscribe production of the photo. i argue that the story of tisha, rita, and mary lee beckon us to re-think the contradictions of civil-rights era progress through project and promise of black gender, a part of what preciado terms an emerging pharmaco pornographic regime of power-knowledge.

wikipedia is one of the world’s most 
widely read websites, with a broad reach to over 500 million monthly visitors. its volunteer contributors are nearly 90% male—a gender disparity reflected in the content. in december 2014, the national women’s studies association and wiki education foundation began a partnership to improve wikipedia’s underrepresented coverage of topics related to women and women’s studies. instructors assign students to expand or create articles related to the course topic, using wiki ed’s tools and instructional materials to design wikipedia assignments that provide a positive learning experience.
wiki ed has supported 60 courses 
within the discipline through this partnership. more than 1,500 students have added over a million words to wikipedia, largely on topics about feminism, sexuality, and gender studies. at this workshop, wiki ed staff will highlight wikipedia’s gender gap, review nwsa’s impact to wikipedia, and discuss the educational benefits of editing wikipedia. join us to learn how to build a wikipedia assignment and how your students can participate in a writing project with real-world implications that go beyond the classroom.presenters

2:45pm - 4:00pm
room 216 (lcd)
this panel addresses the question: 
how do transnational feminist utopian and revolutionary projects involve complicated terrains and power struggles against the backdrop of neoliberal globalization and structural inequities. the panel specifically explores the complex relationship between the south asian feminist movement and the progressive leftist movement, neoliberal feminist subject formation through microfinancing, and feminist-nationalist-neoliberal cultural anxieties around “child marriage.” along the way, it questions who can engage in transnational feminist solidarity building and how discourses of the “new woman” intersect with shifting notions of local and global neoliberal heteropatriarchy and transnational feminist narratives about women’s 
agency in the global south
women’s agency within left political parties 
and the birth of feminist organizations  in bangladesh
 ■seuty sabur, brac university
this paper provides a historical overview 
of how nationalism, secularism, and socialism contoured the 1960s and 1970s bengali feminist movement. it unravels the contested relationship between the bengali feminist movement and the progressive leftist movement and their connection with the bengali nationalist movement, transnational feminist calls, and religious discourses. it explores what kind of agency and power feminists enjoyed within the formal political parties. what led them to form separate feminist organizations? what are the implications of these histories and the ideologies feminists accepted, contested, rejected for the women’s movement in bangladesh today.
“child marriage” and feminist/transnational 
narratives of progress
 ■dina m siddiqi, brac university
this paper addresses the proliferation 
of writing, funding opportunities, and projects around “child marriage” in bangladesh in the past decade. it asks why child marriage has become the site of feminist and nationalist cultural anxiety at this particular conjuncture. extending the pioneering work of shenila khoja-moolji, it explores the dilemmas facing “local” feminists as they grapple with a topic that is of global orientalist and neoliberal interest. what kind of transnational feminist vision is possible in the circumstances? it takes debates around the 2017 child marriage restraint act and the prohibition against “marrying one’s rapist” as the point  of departure.

 ■nafisa tanjeem, lesley university
this paper critically investigates the 
politics of transnational feminist solidarity building in bangladeshi garment labor organizing. it asks what it means for bangladeshi women grassroots labor organizers, who are often restricted by national borders and neoliberal socio-economic-political forces, to engage (or not engage) in transnational solidarity building. it specifically questions why some bangladeshi grassroots feminist and labor organizing initiatives can engage in solidarity building with their transnational allies while others cannot make it. it investigates the politics of access, language, and funding that shapes the nature of participation in transnational feminist activist networks.

recent visual and literary depictions of 
women’s participation in the apparel industry in bangladesh illustrate the emerging and contradictory identities of the empowered woman—the object of neoliberal development policy—as well as structural inequalities that constrain their autonomy. drawing on socially engaged photographs, short story, ad campaigns, and film, i investigate how the discourses of the “new woman” intersect with shifting notions of local and global patriarchy, globalization and women’s emancipation, and with transnational feminist narratives about women’s agency in the global south. the paper discusses possibilities for a critical visual schema for engaging feminism and human rights.

working around anti-feminist  
publishing hierarchies
 ■julie shayne, university of

this presentation approaches the topic 
of publishing feminisms by articulating the publishing hierarchy as an anti-feminist institution. i will ask how said hierarchy, for those bound by the traditional expectations of blind peer-review publishing, holds power over the research agendas of feminist and activist scholars. i will discuss the risks scholars are forced to take in the face of these anti-feminist norms, especially in our attempts to mediate power imbalances in research. i will offer a personal example of a successful work-around.
revolutionary imagining: zines as a space 
for reimagining utopia
 ■aiesha turman, union institute & university
a more just future is one where those 
who have been pushed to the margins are able to be centered. if we are to define utopia, it must include the ability to assert and insist upon one’s agency. with that, i put forth that zine-making is a utopian practice, particularly black feminist zine-making. it acts as a culture in movement that empowers, harmonizes, historicizes, transforms, critiques, and makes room for joy. in mining the feminist zine archive at barnard college, i illustrate how these texts are liberatory and act as a repair of the self.
pedagogies of publishing: exploring an 
intersectional feminist journal praxis
 ■shahar shapira, simon fraser university
 ■ela przybylo, simon  
fraser university
in “pedagogies of publishing,” we reflect 
on teaching senior-level undergraduate students the praxis of feminist publishing. the 400-level course, “intersectional feminist journal praxis” is a project-based course that bridges feminist practice and theory, scholarship and activism. in the seminar, students collectively develop an inaugural issue of an online undergraduate journal, and partake actively, at all levels, in feminist publishing and feminist future-making. our talk explores how new forms of publishing can foster intersectional feminist action, multiple voices and inter-media collaboration, deeper understanding of the dynamics of power flows and in justice, and cross-pollination between popular and academic feminisms.

a feminist environmental justice account of 
korryn gaines’ life and death
 ■catherine jampel, clark university
korryn gaines imagined a world without 
lead poisoning and where she could move as an independent motorist. gaines’ traffic stops and confrontations with police ended in 2016, when baltimore county police fatally shot her. environmental injustice and gendered violence shaped gaines’ life and perspective and are implicated in her death. this paper builds on previous work about disability and environmental justice (johnson 201 1; kafer 2013; jampel 2018) through an explicit attention to race and gender. female anger, motherhood, and especially spaces of home and “the road” shaped the environmental and racial injustices of gaines’ life and responses to her legacy.
the greening of human rights in iran: a 
decolonial feminist approach to universal human-environment rights
 ■a. marie ranjbar, the ohio state university
in this paper, i trace the trajectory, 
visibility, and corresponding legibility of environmental justice protests in iranian azerbaijan to reverse the desiccation of lake orumiyeh. this paper uses feminist decolonial and materialist theory, combined with an empirical analysis of the orumiyeh protests, to show how rights discourses are being expanded beyond humanist framings in iran (lugones 2000, 2003; sundberg 2014). through an analysis of how the orumiyeh movement has ‘greened’ human rights in iran, i argue that these protests are an example of how relational ontological approaches can broaden conceptualizations of universal rights, reflecting new imaginings of environmental justice.

2:45pm - 4:00pm
room 219
navigating white students’ resistance 
is a major challenge for social justice education. whether evidenced by silence, denial, disconnection, or rage, resistance has the power to thwart learning and derail discussion. many educators have minimal training in how to address these emotions and interpersonal dynamics, leaving them to figure out what works through trial and error. in this workshop, we use our background in clinical multicultural psychology and transformative pedagogy (freire, 1970; hooks, 1994) to explore manifestations of resistance and share strategies for addressing such resistance in teaching about race and other systems of power and privilege.

from post to de-colonial feminisms? 
challenging epistemic injustice from the space of trans-modernity ■jayati lal, syracuse university
when news spread that harvard 
feminist legal scholars were constituting a ‘task-force’ to advise the indian government on revisions of rape and the sexual assault laws in the wake of the ‘delhi rape’, and following the release of the government appointed judicial report that incorporated the testimony of over 80 women’s and civil rights groups, indian feminists issued an open letter to the harvard feminists. utilizing irony and humor as a form of decolonial politics, their letter highlights the erasure of their activism. i examine this event as a symptom of epistemic injustice in transnational feminist political projects.
iranian diasporic writings and politics 
of futurity: perks and perils of feminist imagination
 ■yalda nafiseh hamidi, stony brook university
iranian diasporic feminist authors 
in america and europe created an imaginary version of iran in their writings, as a democratic and feminist-friendly homeland. they reject to accept iran on the map, which refused their belonging to the nation as good iranian women and caused their diaspora. in this paper, by re-reading of three novels of this genre, foreigner by rachlin, persepolis by satrapi, and reading lolita in tehran by nafisi, i argue for constructing iran as transnational feminist praxis. on the contrary, i examine how discriminatory xenophobic, islamophobic, and empire-building elements can find their way into this feminist genre.

this presentation is the culmination of 
a conversation between the authors (poonam argade and taveeshi singh) about interrogating how caste travels across national and religious boundaries, and aligns itself with location-specific, structurally embedded relations of power. the objective of this conversation is to: (1) raise questions about what it means to embody dual subjectivities of woman of color and savarna (that is, with caste) in the global north, and (2) turn the lens on the researcher, or the knowledge producer, in the us academy. we hope to build upon conversations on caste that were begun at last year’s

pinjra tod: break the cage movement in india
 ■alka kurian, university of washington, bothell
this paper focuses on pinjra tod, a 
contemporary feminist movement against sexist curfew rules in university halls in india. using a global vocabulary of rights, and led by india’s millennial youth, this movement aims to disrupt brahminical control over women’s lives across familial, communal, and institutional contexts. by centering women’s autonomy and unconditional freedom and rejecting societal infantalization of women, this rights-bearing discourse signals a shift in indian feminism. to make my argument, i draw on monika fludernik’s work on patriarchy as a manifestation of prison, and shilpa phadke’s work on loitering as a radical act for women’s freedom.dismantling the carceral: abolition dreams
 ■shreerekha subramanian, university of 
houston, clear lake
this paper takes up the prison as a site 
of theoretical impasse, a site of suffering that is cemented and cobbled together by structures of capital, patriarchy, and authority into forms of a social injustice that continues to punish the poor and the dispossessed. how can the theoretical levers provided by michele alexander’s work on american caste and systemic disenfranchisement, angela davis’s movement for abolition democracy, jacqui alexander’s practices of feminist spiritual possibilities, and nicole fleetwoods’s methodologies for reading the arrested moment of affect help in undergirding new ways of dreaming up revolutions that move the walls, concrete, metaphoric, implacable?

 ■bethani turley, west virginia university
 ■martina angela caretta, west  
virginia university
feminist geographers study how water 
management is gendered and how productive use of water is privileged over reproductive uses. west virginia’s water quality is threatened by extractive industries. the impact of contamination is gendered, but women’s knowledge of the effects of industrial development is often discredited for being unscientific, and environmental changes affect individual/community identity and sense of place (mchenry 2017; sangaramoorthy et al. 2016). women in wv lead the resistance movements against industry destructive practices. this paper explores how embodied experiences produce local knowledges that inform the current debates around extractive industries.

this paper analyzes the ways in which 
the korea queer culture festival (kqcf) creates a radical space for queer possibility and national belonging in the particular social, historical and political context of south korea. by exploring the kqcf’s relation to the public, social movement history, and the notion of modernity, i challenge the universalizing claim that the kqcf is a capitalist and imperial practice that celebrates lgbtq koreans’ consumerism and the global hegemony. considering contemporary homophobic and transphobic practices that often threaten the safety of queer koreans,  i argue that we interpret the kqcf as a space of grassroots activism.
spect-acting transnational adoption in

 ■jieun lee, university of georgia
this paper analyzes the immersive

(2017) by korean adoptee playwright and scenic designer deb sivigny. this theatrical event takes the spectators through various rooms and visual installations to create interactive and interpretive experiences of transnational adoption from south korea to the united states and korean adoptees’ birth searches in south korea. employing boal’s concept of “spect-actor,” i argue that hello my name is... renders the spectator not just a passive witness but an active participant of the transnational adoption experience, to realize a new understanding of korean adoptees’ liminal belonging across time and space.
daughterhood and the diaspora: asian-

 ■andi remoquillo, university of texas

this paper seeks to dismantle orientalist 
constructions of “the” asian-american household by grappling with the question of how anti-colonial practices can be recognized in first generation and trans-racially adopted women’s (re)negotiations of their gender and racial identities. within these (re)negotiations, narratives of belongingness/unbelongingness also emerge as asian-american women (re)assert their subjecthoods first within the household and in public spaces. through the use of feminist ethnography, this paper analyzes the varying ways that women’s biological or adopted parents have shaped perceptions on gender, race, and culture while also emphasizing the ways in which women generate individual agency outside of their familial networks.

 ■christine capetola, university of texas

what can the vibrations of a prince 
song teach us about different ways of inhabiting flesh—and being together? in this paper, i contend that the vibrations of prince’s “if i was your girlfriend” work as a sensation, or what amber musser describes as a simultaneous subjective experience and means of experiencing the world. i explore how prince’s use of music technology—and embodiment of his female persona camille—reflects an attempt to access femaleness through the materially felt experience of sound and vibration. by interweaving camille’s vocals with the song’s vibrations, prince accentuates an arrhythmic relationality grounded in the oscillations of flesh.

this panel proposes a framework that 
de-centers the white, binary-conforming (bucar & enke, 201 1; stryker & currah, 2014) relatively wealthy trans child with parental support that tends to dominate mainstream and social media representations of trans kids (saketopoulou, 201 1; meadow, 2014). papers draw on queer feminism/critical race/assemblage theory (snorton & haritaworn, 2013; haritaworn et al, 2014) and critical childhood studies (stockton,2009; hodgson,2013) within an anti-poverty/anti-colonial/prison abolition framework (gilmore, 2007; spade, 201 1; quinn & meiners, 2013; coulthard, 2014) to center the ways in which more precarious trans kids are disabled (siebers, 2008) by white supremacist, colonial and binary normative cisgender environments.
reshaping queer and medical methodologies 
towards just engagement with trans children
 ■gabby benavente, university of pittsburgh
this paper argues that in addition 
to medicine, queer discourses are complicit in enacting violence against transgender children. i note that the very perceived hospitality of queer studies to transgender work (stryker,2004,214) erases the ways in which queer theory is complicit in transantagonistic violence. transgender children are dehumanized through the field’s theoretical “mystification,” adapting a term coined by julia serano. neither medicine nor queer studies engage with the material lives of transgender children, but both delegate the exceptional weight of gender, a system constructed and institutionalized by cis people, to the trans child.
how to bring your kids up trans:  
the racialization of care
 ■julian gill-peterson, university of pittsburgh
the twentieth century history of gender’s 
plasticity uproots the normalizing narrative circulating around trans children today, especially its lack of attention to race. this paper shows how white trans children were reduced by medicine to living laboratories, proxies for techniques aimed at altering gendered phenotype. for trans children of color, by contrast, the racialization of plasticity tended to disqualify them as less plastic and therefore less deserving of care, frequently intensifying systems of incarceration. the discourse of plasticity has prescribed one narrow form of futurity through whiteness, while denying a future to those who are barred from  its shelter.
minding the margins: assemblage theory and 
the biopolitics of transgender kids
 ■ann travers, simon fraser university
given the range of complex experiences 
trans kids are vulnerable to, it is crucial to situate transgender kids within broader relations of power and oppression, yet much existing scholarship tends to focus on relatively privileged, rather than socioeconomically marginal, children. in this paper i draw on critical race/assemblage theorizing from trans scholars of color and allies to outline the importance of an integrated anti-oppression approach for understanding and supporting more precarious transgender kids.

la verdad de las mujeres: performing 
utopian justice in post-conflict colombia
 ■tania lizarazo, university of maryland,

colombian feminist collectives have 
been denouncing violence against women (beyond active conflict zones) before official peace negotiations even began. i explore la ruta pacífica de las mujeres’ truth and memory commission through its two reports memory for life and la verdad de las mujeres as an alternative to state-sanctioned justice. as a performance of justice, the staging is not intended to replace official tribunals but to create a space for women’s repertoire (taylor 2003). by performing justice, la ruta interrupts violence with a space of potentiality where women’s stories coexist alongside the archive to imagine what is not yet possible.

analysis of how indigenous 
epistemologies, such as nahua thought, have influenced gloria anzaldúa’s works is abundant, but the influence of chinese spirituality on her thought has been rarely explored in current scholarship. to fill in the gap, this paper will perform what i term as “mestiza translation” to translate anzaldúa’s theory on liminal thinking and inclusive politics delineated in borderlands through the philosophical notion of change in i ching. using i ching as an epistemological anchor for east asian readers, the paper suggests that mestiza translation could serve as an enabler to disseminate anzaldúa’s thought transnationally.misappropriated narratives and stifled 
resistances: chinese feminist movement in an era of little pink
 ■jiling duan, indiana university bloomington
this paper argues that the chinese 
regime has successfully mobilized the youth (the little pink) to cater its agenda through both the hegemonic and post-hegemonic means. i also argue that feminist resistances are now jeopardized by china’s tightening space for progressive advocacies, the booming state-led fabrications and nationalistic ideology that the little pink represents. i discuss the possibility of future intersectional feminist activism that advocates for government accountability in terminating violation of women’s rights while not having complicity in the little pink discourse.

 ■rory barron, university of kentucky
using both oral history and 
autoethnography, this paper examines cross-generational perspectives on feminine, fat bodies and the policing of these bodies in the family sphere and the public sphere. looking at the author’s childhood and adult experience with an analysis of the gendered regulation of bodies, this paper analyzes the different ways that masculine and feminine fat bodies are perceived, how the owners of these bodies perceive themselves, and how they internalize and perpetuate barriers mapped onto fat bodies, revealing how the family can be used as a transformational site and a site that regulates expectations of the public sphere.

9 months to life: pregnancy, carceral toxicity, 
and fetal necropolitics
 ■vic overdorf, indiana university
i examine the crucial intersections of 
death and toxicity in carceral spaces, arguing that incarcerated pregnant women are kept on the constant brink of death. institutional neglect and toxicity in prison environments cultivate a fetal necropolitical state in which the carceral system dictates who does and does not make it into the world. the prison controls environmental toxicity, quality of medical care, and often pregnancy itself based on rape and access to birth control. women are kept in a perpetual state of social death, and pending physical death, hinging upon the perceived value of their lives, and their reproductive capabilities.

 ■mel lynwood ferrara, university of arizona
this paper explores discourses on 
hormones, racialization, sexuality, and understandings of the (in)fertile intersex body in relationship to the state. i examine medical literature, patient narratives, and popular media on early endocrinology and trace these accounts to the contemporary pharmaco-pornographic moment. i explore the treatment of klinefelter syndrome in which individuals, who frequently experience low fertility or infertility are prescribed exogenous testosterone. focusing on the ways endocrinological logics have been co-constitutive of eugenic sciences, i discuss the impact this has had on the management of intersex bodies at the intersection of the carceral state and medical industrial complex.

this paper will explore the little-known 
narratives of jewish women during the holocaust and their experiences with life, (near) death, and pregnancy in the necropolitical landscape of the concentration camps. the paper will also explore the multiple meanings of the pregnant body by examining the female body as “territory and machine,” while also underscoring the institutional regulation and systematic erasure that they have faced. their stories of resistance and struggle illuminate how marginalized women fight for reproductive liberty and challenge thanatopic regimes that seek to control women’s fertility.
suspending animation: gendering time of 
death through reproductive technology
 ■lindsey n breitwieser, indiana university
this paper uses the continued gestation 
of a fetus within a brain-dead pregnant woman to illustrate the biological life/death binary’s role as a technique of necropolitical governance. although politically neutral in theory, i argue that a declaration of brain death operates in practice as a mechanism to gender clinical and legal time of death. by simultaneously declaring maternal death and fostering fetal life, physicians demonstrate their capacity to strategically suspend animation such that a brain-dead pregnant woman must exist in a state of living-death until her role as fetal incubator has been fulfilled.

 ■taneem husain, keene state college
using usama alshaibi’s 201 1 film as 
a lens, this paper envisions a “queer” muslim american identity by insisting on the possibilities of both a sexually perverse islam and a perversely islamic sexuality. profane centers on muna, a muslim arab-american professional dominatrix who works to reconcile her perverse sexuality with her religious and national identities. by doing so, she creates a demonic, monstrous subject that, while liminal, uses both sexuality and racialization to question the boundaries of these various identity categories. ultimately, this demonic anti-identity questions the necessity of identity at all.145

 ■tiffany m. salter, bates college
brony culture has dominated most 
popular and academic conversation about my little pony: friendship is magic, centering men’s identification with and sexualization of the young female horse characters in the cartoon series. queerness abounds as some fans come for the promise of non-normative gender identification and others come for furry fantasy realness. but little attention has been paid to the construction of queer feminist utopic space within the series. this paper traces the kingdom of equestria as an anti-patriarchal safe space for radical feminist collaboration wherein the friendships, desires, and needs of girl ponies take precedence.

 ■j. brendan shaw, central state university
both martha southgate’s 2005 novel 
third girl from the left and the 2014 film dear white people (dir. justin simien) represent black women using filmic technologies as a means not simply to tell a story but also as an element of erotic intimacy. the classic reading of black women’s relationship to the camera is one of fetishization and/or erasure. these two fictional texts offer  a vision of black women entering a queer relationship with the camera which allows exploration of new f orms of bodily connection.  
black women’s bodies become extended and expanded through  their intimate encounters with these  non-human apparatuses.

explorations in the core: writing in/at  
the margins ■katharine p zakos, oglethorpe university
while the core curriculum at many 
colleges and universities is evolving, there are exceptions—many traditional liberal arts institutions continue to maintain the importance of teaching “the canon.” at one such institution, faculty were encouraged to develop “explorations” sections of canonical courses that would offer innovative content while still retaining the underlying theme of the course (in this case, the conceptualization of the self in narrative). i would like to share the takeaways from this experience with other scholars and, hopefully, begin a dialogue about strategies and best practices when diverging from traditional works and methodologies associated with the core.

 ■adriane brown, augsburg college
this paper envisions the liberatory 
potential of the first-year seminar in training students to resist the norms of the university, to see themselves as intellectuals, and to value knowledge production outside of the academy. i discuss my experiences teaching a course on comics and graphic novels produced by people of color and lgbtq people who use this medium to articulate their own stories and experiences of americanness, including texts like kindred, black panther, and bitch planet. i contend that the first-year seminar offers an irreproducible opportunity to train students as revolutionary scholars who see the university as theirs to reshape.

i use these ideas in first year 
composition courses so that we do not have to have specialized audiences – these are methods can introduce the ideas of gender fluidity into every day discussions, leading to a more open and embracing world view. i find this especially helpful for small, rural high schools, colleges, and universities which do not have gender studies programs or a campus culture of inclusion.

two mothers of transnational adoptees: 
transnational child rearing by korean birth mothers and american adoptive mothers
 ■sina lee, university of maryland
this paper traces the circuit of 
transnational adoption through the case of korean adoptees by u.s. couples. adoptees as transnational subjects blur the boundary of nation, state, and normal family. they have been adopted to maintain the normality of white, middle-class, heterosexual families in the u.s. from being subject to an “abnormal family life” in korea. furthermore, this contradictory circumstance reveals who can perform maternity and who cannot. by comparing the narratives of birth mothers and foster mothers of adoptees, this paper explores how maternity, motherhood, the normative family, and love are constructed socially, globally, and transnationally.

analyzing recently proposed legislation regarding the inadequate availability of feminine hygiene products in arizona prisons, this paper argues that both normalized and aberrant instances of the control, exploitation, and abuse of women’s bodily integrity in prisons reproduce systematic means of “selectively controlling the destiny of entire communities through the bodies of women and individuals” (ross & solinger 2017). in this midst, however, this analysis illustrates that such degradations have historically been and are consistently contested, revealing insurgent imaginations that disrupt what is socially embraced in the name of security, rehabilitation, and justice.

hristopher 
paul harris, new school for social researchthis paper uses expressions of pain 
and joy to narrate and theorize contemporary patterns of black resistance. in particular, it explores the way young black folks in and around the movement for black lives (m4bl) “operationalize care,” as both a defining characteristic of their self-elaboration, and as an approach to politics. more than a prefigured political program with a concrete vision of liberation, i argue that m4bl outlines an ethical commitment.  in doing so, the movement reinscribes blackness not simply as a relational category, but as a method of analysis, critique, and disruption towards the possibility of a world otherwise.

this paper is an investigation of existing

 ■meredith lee, university of california, irvine
this paper argues that the debate 
between transgender and transracial identity not only renaturalizes gender within the discourse surrounding transgender identity and politics but disregards blackness as a structural position—an ontology—rather than an identity.  indeed, blackness is not a category of racialization but a position that places black bodies outside of civil society. i consider the recent debate within both the academy and popular culture through rebecca tuvel’s unfortunate article “in defense of transracialism” as well as the various liberal and radical articles on rachel dolezal and caitlin jenner.

i argue that any white queer feminist 
claim to radical resistance must include white death, representationally and otherwise.  i approach the question through the division in queer theory between muñoz’s invitation to create brown queer utopias and the commitment in white queer theory (edelman, dean, winnubst, kafer) to undermining the politics, ethics, and affects of enshrining “the future.”  by engaging dionne brand’s door of no return and exploring recent representations of white death, such as dee rees’ mudbound and ryan coogler’s black panther, i argue that white death must become central to  the white queer feminist labor for  
 radical justice.

reinventing black womanhood in washington, d.c.
4:15pm - 5:30pm
room 204-205 (lcd)
home to established african 
american institutions and communities, washington, d.c., offered women in the new negro movement a unique setting for the fight against racial and gender oppression. colored no more traces how african american women of the late-nineteenth and early twentieth century made significant strides toward making the nation’s capital a more equal and dynamic urban center. drawing from these differing but interconnected african american women’s spaces, this book excavates a multifaceted feminist, cultural history of struggle toward a vision of equality that could emerge and sustain itself. upward mobility to equal citizenship for african american women encompassed challenging racial, gender, class, and sexuality status quos. colored no more maps the intersection of these challenges and their place at the core of new negro womanhood.

decolonial visions of human rights in nnedi 
okorafor’s binti
 ■emily davis, university of delaware
drawing on rosa-linda fregoso’s work 
on decolonizing human rights, i consider how naijamerican sci-fi writer nnedi okorafor’s 2015 novella, binti, animates a decolonial vision of human rights and restorative justice. okorafor’s text, with its “future in which people of color move unfettered through the stars, befriend aliens, make peace between warring factions,” feels distant from our political reality, as amal el-mohtar notes. but it opens an essential space for imagining radical futures.
embodied empathy in opposition to climate 
change in octavia butler and n.k. jemisin ■marykate messimer, university of arkansas
n.k. jemisin’s 2015 novel the fifth 
season creates characters who have a preternatural empathy with the earth, who can feel and shape the land through their own bodies. these characters function as a rather literal incarnation of queer ecological theories that suggest that humanity must reshape its relationship to the environment to value the nonhuman and even the nonliving as kin. jemisin’s characters embody the earth and cannot ignore or misunderstand the environmental catastrophes they cause and experience, allowing the novel to reject the dystopian impulses that shape most fiction in our contemporary era of climate change.
exploring the world of the different: crip 
futures in contemporary literature
 ■anna hinton, southern methodist university
this paper discusses how contemporary 
writers-of-color represent trauma, healing, and alternative, crip futures. in these works, healing involves envisioning futures that de-emphasizes patriarchy and makes space for queerness and disability. by exercising critical, creative analysis of present socio-political conditions, characters revise the past and envision possible futures with fluid and porous national identities, geospatial borders, as well as bodies. these works creatively articulate alison kafer’s yearnings for “more accessible futures, an elsewhere--and, perhaps, an “elsewhen”--in which disability is understood otherwise: as political, as valuable, as integral (3).”
first we must decolonize the imagination: 
examining the liberatory potential of women of color speculative fiction writers
 ■kristin alder, texas woman’s university
if we are to decolonize our societies, we 
must first decolonize our imaginations (imarisha). this paper looks at the work of zainab amadahy, nnedi okorafor, and sabrina vourvoulias and considers how they denaturalize onto-epistemologies of speculative fiction while simultaneously dismantling oppressive social ideologies and structures. as examples of indigenous futurism, afrofuturism, and chican@futurism respectively, these works have unique counter-hegemonic potential. through their portrayals of radical subjectivity, the suspension of fixed binaries, and the wedding of western techno-culture science and non-western beliefs, these works imagine liberatory futures.

disability studies scholars have named 
and challenged the multitude of ways that the university exists as an able-supremacist space, fictionally constructed as if the body-minds that occupy it are normal – and exceptionally normal. furthering this critical work, i describe a formally-inclusive course that attempted to enact a “fugitive space” within able-supremacy. i explore how students’ engagement with the concept of crip time laid bare the tensions - and potential - surrounding contestations  of rigor, productivity, and who counts  as a knower.

room 216 (lcd)
over the past ten years, there has been 
a surge in the production of scholarship on asexuality. with the growth of the field, questions have arisen about how to incorporate this work in the classroom. accordingly, the asexuality studies interest group is sponsoring a session focused on questions of pedagogy: how do we teach about asexualities, and how does the teaching of asexualities reshape our classrooms and pedagogical practices? this panel examines those questions specifically in women’s, gender, and sexuality studies classes and in relation to legacies of decolonial and embodied pedagogies.

asexual pedagogies: erotics and tensions
 ■ela przybylo, simon  
fraser university
drawing on the experience of designing 
and teaching the first ever university course offered on asexuality, this paper reflects on interdisciplinarity, intersectionality, and new media pedagogies. in particular i reflect on how the course analyzed asexuality intersectionally in conversation with racialization, settler colonialism, gender, ability, religion, and science. i engage with two fieldtrips that the students and i undertook, one to the ubc sexual health lab and the other to the local vancouver ace-meetup, and how these shaped class understandings of asexuality. i conclude by discussing possibilities for the development of asexual pedagogies in the gender and sexuality studies classroom.pedagogies of silence and absence: how 
teaching asexualities brings students to new critical methodologies
 ■kj cerankowski, oberlin college
this paper takes seriously la paperson’s 
charge to “theorize in the break,” specifically in sexuality studies courses. the history of sexuality has been charted through desire, practice, and identity, but has rarely been examined through the lenses of “absence” or “silence.” what can we unearth about the construction of sexualities when we examine history’s silences? this presentation offers a case study in teaching a course that centers reading for absence as a methodology, exploring how students grapple with the fullness and presence of silence in order to develop new critical tools in the study of sexuality.
vulnerability in the classroom: (a)sexualities 
and the politics of educational intimacy
 ■alyson k. spurgas, trinity college
in our current political climate, it is 
crucial to rethink vulnerability and intimacy in the classroom. from the #metoo movement and questions of consent and boundaries within all kinds of power relationships, to attacks on professors from the radical right via media platforms such as campus reform, professor watchlists, and other tactics employed explicitly to get critical and leftist professors fired, the student-teacher relationship, and the positionality of professors within educational power structures, more generally, is increasingly fraught. in this paper, i engage theories of decoloniality and asexualities to consider vulnerability in the classroom within this murky (and risky) terrain.

decolonizing kink: indigenous resurgence 
and sexual sovereignty
 ■adria m kurchina-tyson, queen’s university
indigenous-led conversations around 
resurgence, while dealing more overtly with kin- and citizenship, also necessarily include the erotic. this paper extends queer indigenous scholarship on gender and role-fulfillment to practices of kinky sexuality and kinship. specifically, my research explores the ways in which traditional anishinaabek principles of governance center consent and bodily sovereignty in the fulfillment of role-based relationships and sexual, familial negotiations of power. this work problematizes dominant narratives of kinky sexuality that exoticize indigenous sexual cultures, while intervening in contemporary indigenous traditionalisms from a queer, consent-based  theoretical perspective.
indigenous women and tourism in peru: 
re-envisioning gender
 ■maribel morales, carthage college
this paper examines how gender roles 
in indigenous communities in peru are being reimagined in the context of community-based rural tourism, where many women are challenging traditional gender roles by adopting leadership positions and actively contributing to the economy of their families and communities. tourism offers women opportunities for income-generation and entrepreneurship and i argue that it has the potential to contribute to greater gender equality and the empowerment of women. this paper explores the role of weaving cooperatives and other entrepreneurial projects lead by women, like cristina suaña, in re-envisioning gender relationships and its impact on gender equality.
resisting 19th century sentimental biopolitics 
in e. pauline johnson’s performance art
 ■megan vallowe, dalton state college
this presentation considers how the 
performance art of mohawk poet e. pauline johnson resisted sentimental biopolitics in the late 19th century. in order to recover johnson’s performances as an ephemeral resistance, this presentation considers letters, performance attire, poetry performed, and newspaper reviews. in doing so, i discuss how johnson juxtaposed the romanized myth of the indian princess with an aristocratic anglo-american persona, in ways that revealed how those myths supported a settler-colonial racial hierarchy that dehumanized indigenous americans.
translating across ontologies: feminist 
decolonial perspectives
 ■claudia de lima costa, federal university of 
santa catarina
this essay places latin american 
feminisms in conversation with academic/activists who claim the need to decolonize knowledge. by emphasizing an intersectional approach to understand the gendered character of coloniality, decolonial feminists seek innovative ways of articulating new epistemologies that question the divisions between human/nonhuman; nature/culture. in focusing on the issue of translation - based not only on a linguistic paradigm, but on an ontological one - i will argue that a politics of translation is crucial to the decolonial turn, and to build partial connections across different ontological formations to confront the equivocations or mistranslations that hinder  feminist alliances.

better never means better for everyone: 
blackness in hulu’s the handmaid’s tale
 ■mia victoria lawrie, university of washington
“the handmaid’s tale” is television 
adaptation based on margaret atwood’s novel about a christian totalitarian police-state that overthrows the us government, and forces working class and poor women to serve as reproductive surrogates, propagating the future of the elite. despite the source material’s insistence that gilead was a white supremacist state, the showrunner’s decided to cast black actors in two crucial roles in the series. through character analysis, i speculate how the insertion of black characters changes the story’s narrative and the ideology of post-apocalyptic gilead, questioning for whom this is dystopian narrative and for whom is it repeated history.
heaven, a place on earth?: queer 
temporality beyond the corporeal in ‘san junipero’
 ■mia victoria lawrie, university of washington
set in the not-so-distant future and the 
iconic 1980’s, black mirror episode “san junipero” portrays two women experiencing queer love, disability, grief, and eventually death. the titular town, a simulated reality in which the dead can live forever, and the elderly can visit, demonstrates how technology can be used to benefit those on the margins. exploring the significance of the utopian possibilities and limitations of the episode, i argue that “san junipero” operates on “queer-“ and “crip time” allowing its inhabitants to live in a usable past, while simultaneously having access to a futurity that outlasts their physical form.

a collaboration between a scholar 
of chinese feminisms and a feminist theorist who has worked mainly on the us and europe, this paper seeks to outline paradoxical cross-currents between chinese and western feminism, and also to re-claim the revolutionary inheritance of chinese feminism. we examine how chinese feminist theorizing in the 21st century continues the revolutionary project of chinese feminism, advocating for gender equality while also imagining alternatives to china’s contemporary neoliberal, nationalist project. as chinese feminists resist patriarchal tendencies in both the chinese communist party and neoliberalism, we trace continuities between past and present through transnational currents.
chinese feminists’ political “i-portrait”: 
reimagining cosmopolitanism and gender equality from a century ago
 ■weiling deng, university of california,  
los angeles
the cultural revolutionary repertoire of 
the new culture movement in early twentieth century, which irreversibly involved and arguably enlightened china in the constructed discourses of modernity against/with the east-west divide, is frequently invoked by the chinese feminists today. focusing on the transformed meaning of individual(ism), on which a package of the imaginations of justice, democracy, and equality is grounded, i examine the voice of “i” in chinese feminists’ self-portrayal on social media that reiterates and reinvents china’s first enlightenment movement. this research sheds light on the understudied, transnationally informed theorization of chinese social problems made by the chinese feminist cosmopolitans.
postcolonial secular feminist sectarianism and 
the conscripting logics of the war on terror
 ■nadia guessous, colorado college
when founding members of the 
moroccan feminist movement declared their independence from male-dominated leftist political parties and movements in the 1980s and created autonomous organizations, they chastised the left not only for its sexism but also for its sectarianism. yet, the leftist feminist promise of an inclusive feminist movement has been far from realized in the past three decades. this paper offers a transnational feminist reading of this hampered feminist utopia that highlights the relationship between secular forms of feminist exclusion (mahmood, scott, brown) and the conscripting logics of both colonial modernity (scott) and the war on terror (puar, masad).

reimagining the nature narrative:

the separation of humans from nature 
serves as a normalized narrative within settler colonialism and molds present-day experiences of nature. native practices that shared a connection to the landscape have been replaced with hierarchies and delineations that work both to conceal the interconnections that exist and to erase accountability for the destructive practices that have led to environmental degradation. drawing from indigenous and spiritual activist theorizing, this paper reimagines the nature narrative for the purpose of our earth’s future by acknowledging the spirit in all entities, human and nonhuman, as a way to resituate oppressive frameworks.

the face of war
 ■veronica popp, texas woman’s university
a woman in berlin (1945) is a testament to the survival of women in berlin, post wwii. the writer is 34-year-old journalist. to avoid rapes, women had arrangements with officers in the russian army to protect themselves and neighbors. the text is clear; women’s value was within their bodies as spoils of war. rape was constant; therefore, women chose their rapists. i argue, using anzalduan theories including, coyolxauhqui and soy un amasmiento, this text provides an opportunity to heal from fragmentation, and knead together light and dark as a source of healing, adding a face to war and occupation.

reimagining futures without violence: 
challenging the equation of freedom  with independence
 ■amy piedalue, university of melbourne
highlighting the critical insights of 
grassroots women’s collectives in hyderabad, india and seattle, u.s.a., this paper explores the innovative work of muslim and south asian women in (re)imagining justice in response to domestic violence. the creative energy, community-embedded praxis, and audacious visions of these organizations offer pathways to ‘demand the impossible’ - women’s freedom from violence. they weave together resistance to gendered violence and state violence. at the same time, their work challenges the globally dominant discourse that ‘leaving’ - or gaining ‘independence’ from family (and community) - is the best way to secure freedom from violence or ‘gender justice’ for survivors.
theorizing justice for black women: 
integrating black feminist praxis into restorative justice scholarship
 ■abigail barefoot, university of kansas
restorative justice offers a re-imaging of 
justice outside of carceral punishments by using the community to develop systems of accountability and repair. despite restorative justice’s intersectional roots, the academic field of restorative justice often erases the contributions and experiences of black women in favor of a hegemonic approach that universalizes restorative justice’s approach to gender-based violence. through analyzing community-based restorative justice organizations, i argue integrating black feminist theory into restorative justice scholarship allows for a more intersectional analysis which re-centers the lived realities of black women and provides a more holistic approach to using restorative justice to address gender-based violence.
urgency with heart: making space for 
emotional labour in antiviolence work
 ■emily rosser, university of windsor
this paper lays theoretical groundwork 
to explore the relationship between emotional labour and the sustainability of urgent antiviolence work. the paper is situated in foundational antiracist feminist scholarship by audre lorde and sara ahmed, and a range of transnational feminist work on human rights. it builds on my previous research demonstrating how urgency circumscribed the emotional worlds and the knowledge produced by human rights workers documenting wartime sexual violence. embedded in a sexual violence prevention context in the unfolding #metoo movement, this paper outlines theoretical affinities between disparate struggles for accountability and sustainability, to further develop collective feminist capacity.

between the national and global—  
the mastery masculinity as the bridge
 ■charlie (yi) zhang, university of kentucky
donald trump is framed as a contentious 
rival trumpeting a nationalist worldview with the chinese president xi jinping, who emerges as the new cosmopolitan leader of globalization. drawing upon a variety of public resources, including media coverage and propagandist materials, this essay, however, seeks to untangle the epistemological and ideological liaison—what i call “mastery masculinity”—that integrates the two. despite their disparate persona as a predatory misogynist/a benevolent paternal protector, i argue they both build their political power on the domineering and unrelenting masculinity that paves the way for imposing authoritarianism as the collective threat to the world.
not in your imagined future: china’s 
“missing girls” and the epistemology from the disappeared
 ■xin huang, university of wisconsin-milwaukee
this paper explores the transnational 
connection between the “missing girls” in china and the “disappeared” in the 1970s due to state terror in the southern cone. it considers the “missing girls” with other theoretical categories of modern subjectivity, such as the precariat, the surplus, the disposable, the queer, and in relation to the centrality of disappearance to modern biopolitical governance across the world. examining the political implications of bringing the disappeared back “alive,” it asks, how does an epistemology accounts for those who “are not supposed to be here” shape gender politics today and the nation’s imagination of the future?
reclamation or revolt? towards an insurgent 
understanding of intimate nationalism
 ■danmei xu, university of california,  
los angelesthis paper analyzes the gendered and 
sexual performances, street violence, and affective circulations of nationalist protests erupting across contemporary urban china as a theatrical archive that counterintuitively puts pressure on the coherence of “chineseness” and disassembles the post-socialist nation. such volatile and affectively charged spaces, i contend, demand a more capacious understanding of state violence and resistance as such. writing against the antinormative turn of queer studies (wiegman and wilson 2015), i return to the site of “normativity,” that is, mass nationalist mobilizations, as an insurgent space abounded with a felt sense of critique, controversy,  and contestation.
chinese leftover women’s refusal to embrace 
marital autonomy: rethinking feminist relational theory
 ■qian liu, university of victoria
current research studies on women’s 
choices in family formation generally focus on women’s autonomy, or autonomous choices. feminist scholars in the field of family have started to use relational theory to discuss women’s choices in marriage, childbearing, and parenting. feminist relational theory has a strong attachment to autonomy. however, my interviews with 72 chinese women show they refuse to embrace autonomy in marital choices. i argue that autonomy should not be the focus when feminist relational theorists apply relational theory to analyse the choices of women whose worldviews are not organised around values like autonomy, individualism, and equality.

planting a good life: women’s organic work 
in maine
 ■clark a pomerleau, university of north texas
the back-to-the-land movement that 
pulled people to rural maine resulted in individual and organizational breakthroughs for sustainable living. baby boomer women had room to cultivate their talents and rethink relationships to societal institutions. they helped found the country’s oldest organic trade and education organization, the maine organic farmers and gardeners association (mofga 1971). interviews with these women reveal overlapping concerns to harmonize people with the rest of nature. these environmentalist farmers have worked locally and through mofga against dominant values to link rebuilding the soil to nutrition, vegetarianism, and animal welfare.
women of color living in lesbian and 
feminist land communities
 ■julie r. enszer, university of mississippi
women living and building arco iris, 
“a spiritual community for womyn and children of color” based in arkansas, regularly contributed to maize, a magazine for women’s land-based communities. juana maria paz documented her experiences living on women’s land from 1976 through 1980 in a small chapbook, the la luz journal. women writing and publishing in maize recognized the challenges of building land-based communities and the challenges of building multi-racial coalitions. yet the vision of both persisted. this paper explores women of color’s contributions to print culture from land communities and how land communities grappled with race and racism
this land is our land? interconnection and 
political praxis in rural feminism
 ■agatha beins, texas woman’s university
country women, a feminist magazine 
published in northern california in the 1970s, articulated an antiracist vision of feminism, but the magazine did not consistently grapple deeply with race as an identity category. this elision occurred in part because of the vision of interconnection contributors explicitly and implicitly articulated. women’s interaction with the land sculpted a place-based understanding of interconnectedness between living and nonliving beings and at local and planetary scales. while contributing to a powerful critique of capitalism and imperialism, it reveals the challenge of creating new worlds while attending to the material realities of the present moment.

through film and dance performance,

collaborations among embodiment,

2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: friday, november 9mestiza consciousness is an 
analytical tool based in the work of gloria anzaldúa that allows us to bridge oppositions and exclusions. many academics recognize that decolonization is necessary because of the lack of non-eurocentric ways of knowing within the production of knowledge. thus, this presentation shows a performativity exercise mediated by language, colonized social practices, folklore, dance and spiritual rituals. this presentation reflects gonzalez’s personal quest to engage and understand a mestiza latina pedagogy in order to pursue embodied ways of knowing, healing, and agency.
things i learned from fat people on the

 ■kimberly dark, california state university, 
san marcos
in her solo-play, things i learned from 
fat people on the plane, dark focuses on stories about stigmatized fatness, while her body is performing resistance to social stigma based on size and gender. the body that doesn’t fit in normative spaces - like airplane seats, conference chairs, lifejackets, and aisle ways - is constantly visible and simultaneously invisible. performance brings it into being – not only scrutinized, but seen. this session invites discussion of dark’s embodiment in a performance excerpt. specifically, how her embodiment adds a layer of “future imagining” to a story that occurred in the past.

despite myriad watershed moments 
within popular culture and many critical interventions by black queer theorists, activists, and artists across generations, queer and trans identities are still whitewashed within (white) mainstream media. black queer and trans people still face invisibility within popular media, but also hypervisibility within normative “gay” places and spaces where we are often policed and antagonized. the hegemony of queer whiteness as “unraced,” coupled with white supremacy, allows white queer people the space to disavow their race privilege while simultaneously reifying people of color as the racial other.

global commodities or critical subjects?: an

a 2007 associated press headline 
read “giving birth outsourced to india.” nearly 10 years later, a headline in the la times read “india scales back ‘rent-a-womb’ services.” both articles are about indian women offering paid surrogacy to westerners. this project analyzes articles about paid surrogacy to challenge the protectionist idea that wombs are global commodities and surrogates only victims. instead, using beauvoir’s idea of embodied risk and concrete freedom, i suggest that surrogates are subjects possessing choice and agency. however, such agency is constrained by policies seeking to protect them from a choice that provides a previously unimagined–even utopian–future.

‘governing’ violence in the context of intimacy
 ■halimah deshong, the university of the

feminist intellectuals have long exposed 
the structural violence of normative gender and sexuality, enshrined in caribbean legislative response to gender-based violence (gbv) (robinson 2004; alexander 2005; lazarus-black 2003 & 2007). inspired by these and other anti-colonial feminist frameworks (wynter 2003; lugones 2010 & 2016; mendez 2015; deshong 2018), i examine the ‘governing’ of gbv interventions in st. vincent and the grenadines based on interviews with 16 members of the criminal justice system and activists, and caribbean gbv legislation. harmful assumptions about race, gender, class and sexuality persist in these attempts at remediation.

 ■roberta hunte, portland state university
maternal and infant health are

 ■ashley coleman taylor, agnes scott college
this paper explores queer and trans 
performance, embodiment, and ancestral memory through the story of a nightclub which served as a safe space for black queer and trans community-building and self-making in the “black gay mecca.” employing oral histories from black lgbt community members, i highlight the marquette, the south’s oldest black queer club as a site of legacy, gender performance, and belonging. this exploration offers a counternarrative to the foreboding, fast-paced gentrification of the city and erasure of black sites. by centering the marquette, i ask what role these memories might play in the future of the southern metropolis.
black feminist dystopian thought as history 
and historiography
 ■alys eve weinbaum, university  
of washington
black feminist speculative fictions 
are associated with utopianism and afrofuturism —with acts of imagination that move us beyond racism, sexism, and colonialism into an alternative future. while this association warrants exploration, this paper suggests focus on a related if distinct association between black feminism and dystopianism.  it argues that black feminist dystopianism constitutes a political resource that can transform our present into the historical past, and, in so doing, constellate slavery, colonialism, and genocide  with present realities. such dystopianism simultaneously instructs us in how to mobilize the creative imagination historiographically, and in how to catalyze radical transformation of present realities.exploding the spectacle: the urgency of (re)
graphing blackness in kindred
 ■kiana murphy, university of pennsylvania
this paper broadly considers the way 
black cultural objects challenge the fixity of race and also teach us to see and read blackness otherwise/elsewhere. closely examining kindred and its graphic novel adaptation, this paper will also posit the radical potentialities of the black body/flesh as it is imagined in the speculative mode. what would it mean to consider octavia butler as an early black feminist theorist of the flesh? what radical futures does the vanishing black woman activate? how is the spectacle of the black body revised in butler’s novel and exploded in the graphic novel?
“hiding under the covers: horror’s exclusion 
of racial and gender diversity”
 ■jonina luisa stump, union institute &

horror narratives mix the perverse with 
fear of the unknown. the immersion opens audiences to reflect on integral parts of the genre: femininity and displacement. hogle suggests it’s the “unconscious” base of gothic horror which “seem[s] to [hold] patriarchal structures” (12). whether the monster kills the couple having sex in the woods, or chases down the final girl, women’s roles are underscored and denied, while minorities are ignored. although books like venus hum (2008) and films like get out (2016) have broken barriers, overall, the chance for reflection and inclusion is missed by horror stories of the past and present.

black feminism and collective intimacy: 
towards a hemispheric approach to contemporary black politics and  social movements
 ■alysia mann carey, university of chicago
this paper interrogates the role of 
intimacy in contemporary black mobilizations throughout the americas. i argue that black women’s experiences with anti-black violence are often articulated and interpreted through a collective lens, whereby black women use a language of intimacy to describe their experiences with state violence, and also use domains of the intimate to empower themselves, families, and communities. drawing on collaborative research with black feminist organizations in brazil and colombia, i analyze the ways that a politic of collective intimacy provides a way to resist state violence, hold community and family members accountable,  and envision justice beyond the state.

damn the dam! analyzing the gendered 
impacts of a large-scale irrigation project  in northern ghana
 ■elisabeth garner, pennsylvania state university
women’s limited access to irrigated 
farming is well documented; however, few examine this from a systems approach. this paper explores the gendered impacts of irrigation projects on intersecting environmental and economic structures. in-depth interviews explore this case in an indigenous community in northern ghana. a large-scale dam project increased the access to and ease of irrigated farming while simultaneously decreasing the informality and availability of land. as women adjust their livelihood strategies, the outcome is environmental and economic inequity grounded in social and gendered dynamics of land, water, markets and agriculture.
erasures of fisher women’s voices in 
mumbai’s “sustainable” development
 ■aparna parikh, pennsylvania state university
this paper shows how indigenous 
women disproportionately bear the burden of neoliberal development. drawing on experiences of fisher women in mumbai’s bhandarwada village, i examine impacts of the growth of the neoliberal service sector in close proximity to the community. land infill for this development and resulting pollution has destroyed fishing-based livelihoods, altering patterns for livelihood, social reproduction, and natural resource governance along gendered lines. women’s voices are silenced even in resistance to this development. marshalling insights from feminist  political ecological scholarship, i argue that women’s experiences showcase how patriarchal norms are reconfigured yet persist in response to  neoliberal development.
more water for the asparagus than for  
the workers
 ■maria del rosario castro castro bernardini, 
pennsylvania state university
this paper explores the intersection of 
labor and gender in the context of water scarcity in the development of peru’s asparagus industry. scholarship shows that this industry plays an important role in the peruvian economy at the cost of labor vulnerability and water depletion. within this dynamic, my qualitative field-based research examined the gendered dynamics of workers at asparagus fields and at home. the study reveals that the existence of a water crisis might intensify the vulnerability of labor conditions and the hardships of domestic chores, in a context of the clear gender division  of labor.

through their post-genocide activism 
(1981-1990), guatemalan maya women, despite extreme exclusion and discrimination, have created spaces in local, national and international spheres for substantive change in attitudes about their power to impact civil society crises. their knowledge, resilience and drive for social justice have forced action on issues of indigenous land rights, environmental devastation, national sovereignty and “citizenship,” as they act on global economic and environmental crises facing guatemala/central america countries. through a10-year qualitative 167

289. amc: the revolution has come: 
black power, gender, and the black panther party in oakland
8:00am - 9:15am
room 204-205 (lcd)
this book examines the impact of 
women’s experiences, internal politics and political repression on the evolution and dissolution of the black panther party in oakland, california. spencer shows how members interpreted, implemented, and influenced party ideology and programs, how they dialogued about gender politics, and organizational priorities. challenging the belief that the panthers were a projection of the leadership, spencer draws on interviews with rank-and-file members, fbi files, and archival materials to examine the impact the organization’s internal politics and cointelpro’s political repression had on its evolution and dissolution. spencer also centers gender politics and the experiences of women and their contributions to the panthers and the black power movement as a whole, providing a panoramic view of the party’s organization over its sixteen-year history.

290. pushing back, failing forward, 
and slowing the machine: resisting neoliberal knowledge production
8:00am - 9:15am
room 206
in this workshop, we will speak from 
our unique positionalities (program administrators, tenured faculty, teaching faculty, contingent faculty) within a rural r2 university that caters to a large student population who feels they have no agency within knowledge production. we will first briefly individually address our own experiences attempting to facilitate student agency of knowing and unknowing via avenues of approachable intellectualism, slow pedagogy, co-construction of knowledge, and failing forward as a revolutionary strategy of empowerment. we will then facilitate breakout discussions on these topics around how we as feminist educators practically employ pedagogical strategies in and beyond the classroom.

“feminism will be intersectional or it will 
be bullshit”: politics and intersectionality in feminist theory and practice
 ■rhiannon love auriemma,  
northwestern university
intersectionality is the mainstream 
theoretical contribution in feminist theory. the concept promises endless inclusion of subjects, making it attractive for the study of identity. feminism in its institutional forms has invested in neoliberal projects of diversity and inclusion. a sanitized version of intersectionality becomes attractive because of its hopeful stake in inclusion and diversity. this paper focuses on the depoliticizing effects the institutional demand for intersectionality has had. the paper articulates how common uses of intersectionality focus on individuals and the amount of privilege they have (or lack) rather than how institutions privilege some over others.
my dildo called nicaragua: exploring the 
rhetorical strategies of queer women of color author-activists in the 1980s
 ■sonja annalise benton, montana  
state university
as i finished my undergraduate time at 
msu, i encountered gloria anzaldua and audre lorde, and was struck by how deeply they spoke to me. the activists doing work around me were using the same kind of language and talking about the same kind of concepts. why is their brand of activism so lasting, even in an age which they never managed to see? and what about their choices-from their integration of the personal, to their anger, to their use of multi-lingualism, and beyond-can create a lasting model for activist language?168
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: saturday, november 10“this is what a native looks like”:  
 academic feminist spaces and the  
“logic of elimination”
 ■judy rohrer, university of california, berkeley
in this paper i share ways i have seen 
native colleagues and their knowledges (native, feminist, and otherwise) denied and rejected in progressive/feminist academic spaces. the attempts i witnessed to eliminate/disappear/erase these colleagues fell into three broad categories: not being recognized as “real” natives; not being seen as adequately feminist; and disappearing behind/into a near totalizing black-white racial binary. these occurrences are homegrown demonstrations of the structural persistence of settler colonialism manifest in the “logic of elimination.”
what does it mean to be seen?: black 
women’s negotiations of professional spaces
 ■alexis grayce stanton, university of virginia
 ■lindsey burnside, university of michigan
black feminist theorists discuss the 
nuances of black women’s engagement in “professional” spaces (collins, 2000; omolade, 1994). while hooks (1990) describes the importance of black women supporting, respecting, and seeing one another despite their social positions, environments such as academia and other workplace institutions, may inhibit positive connections. this study will utilize focus groups to investigate the role of cultural, as well as gendered and racialized social expectations in black women’s daily lives and professional settings. we hope to highlight black women’s vigilance in navigating these spaces, and elucidate how institutions can be restructured to support these  
positive connections.

education as the practice of freedom—not 
finance: strategies in feminist pedagogy for reclaiming higher education from the neoliberal corporatized university model
 ■sarah tucker jenkins, university of virginia
colleges and universities in the u.s. are 
being managed to an ever-increasing degree like corporations (bok, 2003; brown, 2015; giroux, 2002). this shift de-emphasizes critical thinking, and removes any focus on the public good. this paper will use feminist pedagogy (bondy et al., 2015; gayá & brydon-miller, 2016; hooks, 1994; llewellyn & llewellyn, 2015; mountz et al., 2015; thayer-bacon, 2013) to analyze possible solutions to the rise of neoliberalism and consider ways that universities, as well as communities and individuals, can benefit from a feminist/liberatory approach to higher education.
expansive creativity: mapping mechanizations 
of legitimation and of resistance in graduate professional development
 ■ariana hajmiragha, tufts university
drawing on qualitative research at 
a private, r1 university, this paper considers the hegemonic functions of neoliberalism, the university, and professionalization (falcón et al., 2014; harney & moten, 2013), particularly with respect to graduate education. i explore professional development as an example of hegemony constantly responding to crisis (gramsci, 1971) and reimagine what graduate professional development might entail. inspired by critical feminist scholars and critical race theorists, i propose a new approach to career and personal development: expansive creativity. this approach resists the neoliberal status quo while imagining new possibilities for the relationship between graduate scholarship and work.
telling new stories in academia: subjectivity 
and neoliberalism entangled
 ■susan cannon, georgia state university
 ■teri holbrook, georgia state university
the authors of this paper, three university 
professors and a doctoral student, are all engaged in cross departmental/disciplinary work that asks them to consider how they are produced and read in the academy. they think with haraway (2016) about the future of the universities, schools, and knowledge production and ask what other stories might be told and enacted of becoming researcher while engaging in doctoral studies, going up for tenure and promotion, resisting disciplinary boundaries, and on and on... and how these stories and becomings come  
to matter.
the leaderfull moment: problematizing  
the ‘everyone-can- be-a- leader’ model  
in higher education
 ■nicole ferry, city university of seattle
contemporary theories of leadership suggest that everyone can be a leader given the proper training, and leadership research has largely concentrated on identifying the specific processes or behaviors of leaders to improve leadership development efforts. considering a socio-political-economic and historical understanding of leadership—with special attention to the rise of the neoliberal moment—this presentation proposes a critical examination of the ‘everyone-can- be-a- leader’ model as an ostensibly inclusive approach and looks at how such meritocratic narratives may legitimate and normalize systemic inequality and inequities.

belonging and knowledge production:  
toward a feminist ethnography
 ■stacey hunt, auburn university
despite feminist critiques of the 
limits of identity politics as the basis for knowledge production, group membership is now a tacit prerequisite both in women’s studies and american universities generally in order to study 169
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: saturday, november 10any given group. liberal models of 
diversity employed by universities reduce individuals to static, exclusive group membership, and they have surprisingly coincided with feminist’s increasing reliance on identity politics in order to make knowledge claims. in this paper i consider the potential of a radical feminist ethnography as a way to overcome these binds, recognizing experiential knowledge while not being reduced to it.
critical solidarity in the neoliberal university
 ■chris cartright, georgia southern university
across the us, campuses will celebrate women’s history month in march.  this celebration is a salient example of how neoliberalism can co-opt identity politics in ways that are often unseen, but can have the unintended structural impact of alienating potential allies and already marginalized groups like trans-women. the hegemony of this neoliberal discourse is illustrated through our packaging of diversity initiatives often at the expense of deep critical engagement and analysis of the matrix of domination.  we argue that women’s history month and other identity-oriented programs can inadvertently work to reify difference, even as they should work to foster solidarity.
gender equity or corporate strategy: queering 
the critique of title ix
 ■sara lewis, san francisco state university
this paper examines the effects of the 
title ix industrial complex, by which i refer to the interdependent relationship between government, university, and corporation to manufacture a neoliberal illusion of gender equity on college campuses. publicly understood as a feminist intervention, i argue that the implementation of title ix through compliance driven institutional structures serves to regulate gender and sexuality according to binary logics which reinforce the social hierarchies on which the university is dependent. what are the limitations of institutionalized gender equity? who gets rendered invisible through the structures that exist, and at what benefit to the university?whiteness, inheritance, and haunting: 
transforming futures through connection  
with our ancestors
 ■ilana turner, university of minnesota
this paper examines the disconnect, 
among white people, between the inheritance of wealth and accountability to the systemic violence that created contemporary wealth. through a collage of personal reflection, family history, and historical account, this paper interrogates the structured forgetting that makes such ongoing participation in racial capitalism possible. drawing on frameworks of memory and haunting, i imagine how deliberate connection with our ancestors might transform the future by demanding intergenerational accountability from white people for our inheritance of, and continued participation in, white supremacy.

imagining multispecies justice through  
non-human eyes
 ■harlan eugene weaver, kansas  
state university
discourses of dog rescue today are 
increasingly interwoven with the language and material expectations of whiteness and white saviorism. in troubling these dynamics, this paper interrogates the kind and quality of justice involved in such moves to salvation. turning to alternate modes of engagement such as “harm reduction”-styled welfare work that brings together and prioritizes anti-racist and anti-capitalist interventions, this paper envisions a form of multispecies justice through which marginalized humans and animals might come to thrive, together.
re-framing “the pig bomb”: feral intimacies 
as potentiality
 ■logan n. o’laughlin, duke university
populations of wild and feral hogs 
are exploding across the u.s. and these aggressive beasts are invading family farmers’ property -- or so goes the refrain from interviewees of the discovery channel’s show pig bomb (2012). this paper troubles the trope of wild hogs as a hyper-reproductive invasive species by examining how captive pigs were instrumental to european colonization of north america. this context is missing in contemporary narration of white farming families as rightful landowners 170

proposes sitting with ferality as a means to think decolonially about borders and property.
articulating feminist politics of work and 
welfare through animal retirement
 ■juno salazar parrenas, the ohio  
state university
a herd of dairy cows are “retired” 
in the german state of nordrhein-westfalen. given that many elderly women entitled to retirement rights in the german welfare state experience uncertainty regarding retirement—retirement earnings correlate with a lifetime of earned income—the choice of “retirement” is a curious one. drawing from ethnographic work about retirement and geriatric care in nonhuman animals, this paper engages with feminist socialist critiques of work in examining human and nonhuman welfare; it asks: what forms of multispecies economic justice are possible in more than  human worlds?
crows peck at it: jetsam on busted shorelines 
of the fracture commons
 ■july hazard, university of washington
being at a shore is an occasion of 
awareness, and the self that perceives there lapses into jetsam. this scattered personhood coincides with other coastal scatter and fragmentation, and (re)collects itself in recognition, of crows, for instance. i consider several sets of birds at different altered shorelines—crows along seattle’s montlake cut, night herons at the outlet of lake merritt in oakland, and gulls on dead horse bay at the edge of brooklyn—and their various quarries. studying what they peck at can lead to recognition of a constantly rearranging post-capitalist relation of justice that unworks species boundaries.
cruising toxicity: salmon signals toward 
justice in puget sound
 ■cleo assan woelfle-erskine, university  
of washington
coho salmon returning from the ocean 
to urban creeks encounter a stew of toxins washed off the streets, and die precipitously before they can spawn. this ‘pre-spawning mortality’ is a signal of larger contamination that amplifies death legacies of colonial encounters, of poisons that concentrate along shoreline corridors of industry. among humans, this contamination disproportionately burdens black, brown, and indigenous bodies. placing muñoz’s ‘brown commons’ along creeks and into the tidal zone, i map a diffuse call and response around puget sound waters. i look for traces of just multispecies futures reflected somewhere in these toxic ebbs and flows.

geo/objects, or area impossible
 ■anjali r. arondekar, university of california, 
santa cruz
the origin story of neoliberalism has 
centered the project of u.s. empire and queer studies such that the geopolitical appears only in the guise of resurgent markets, emerging fiscal possibilities, risky terrains marked by the incursions of u.s. capital. i will engage with “geopolitical” forms of knowledge that refuse and/or challenge the emphasis on development and globalization as sites of dissent, to raise two central issues: (1) that ‘geopolitical’ epistemes continue to be discounted as ‘local’ and/or ‘parochial’ ; (2) that ‘geopolitical’ categories are historically located social phenomena with specific genealogies that are routinely in spaces of contest and translation.
discipline and publish: at the queer and 
middle east studies crossroads
 ■maya mikdashi, rutgers university
this paper examines the methodological 
and disciplinary questions that arise at the intersection of queer and middle east studies. in particular, i focus on questions related to language, historical, and ethnographic training in both fields and the epistemological, methodological, and political contradictions that may flourish at the intersection of “middle east studies” and “queer studies.” this paper will also address how these contradictions may manifest on the academic job market.
queer moves: queer theory, mobility,  
and empire
 ■mary marchan, university of minnesota
from the common narrative of ‘coming 
out’ to new academic concepts, like ‘queer diaspora’ and ‘queer migration,’ much of queer theory has privileged mobility as definitive of queerness. this paper investigates the trope of mobility in queer theory, and asks, “what becomes fixed in the mobilization of queer?” specifically, i interrogate the ways in which the trope of mobility in queer theory may (re)produce imperial narratives that, on one hand, emphasize travel, exploration, and discovery for specific bodies, while fixing other bodies in place; and on another hand, write certain places as ‘global’ and others as perpetually ‘local.’
improperly queer: queer and trans studies 
texts and subtexts
 ■sima shakhsari, university of minnesota
the fields of queer and transgender 
studies remain invested in epistemes that center the u.s. knowledge production industries. from hiring practices to curriculum development, promotion, and tenure, the standards of the “field” compel scholars to reproduce the euro-american canon. in this paper, i ask what is considered to be a properly queer text for a queer and/or transgender studies course? has the quest for antinormativity produced its own norms wherein geopolitical concerns that neither privilege the u.s. sexual formations, nor indulge in the celebration of antinormativity become too queer for queer/ trans studies courses?

chicken attack: e-democracy and #metoo in 
post-socialist estonia
 ■helis sikk, depauw university
there have not been many hashtag 
social justice campaigns as transnational in their scope as the #metoo movement. this paper takes a critical look at the campaign in estonia and explores the role of online feminist communities in shaping democracy in post-socialist eastern europe. estonia is known for its investment in digital society since its re-independence in 1991 with the introduction of e-taxes, e-voting, e-healthcare, and e-residency. this paper argues that there are alternative effects to state sanctioned e-democracy that are found in feminist challenges  to bio-political state discourses of female animality.

bedbug was eradicated in the us by the chemical ddt. following the berlin wall’s fall in 1989, the borders between post-socialist countries and the west reopened, ultimately leading to bedbug resurgence. bedbugs infest through “traumatic insemination” whereby the female’s abdomen is pierced by the male’s sword-like penis. this paper argues that bedbug’s queer reproduction and ability to cross geopolitical and skin borders trouble the notion of reproductive futurism. through the discourses of transnational feminism and queer theory, this paper deconstructs the national, racial, species-oriented, and class-based hierarchies that bedbug infestations and interspecies intimacy uphold.
 reproducing the estonian nation in the 
context of neoliberal biopolitics
 ■raili marling, university of tartu
estonia’s assertive pronatalist public 
discourse stands in tension with the gender policies of the eu, of which estonia is a member. estonian women are regularly exhorted to bear children for the nation. simultaneously, estonia has prided itself on its technological and market orientation and hence estonian women are also expected to act as good neoliberal subjects. building on the work of michel foucault, wendy brown and jemima repo, the present paper seeks to interrogate the troubled marriage of nationalism and neoliberalism in the estonian context to ask, more broadly, how the biopolitical contributes to 21st century understanding of nationalism.

“ain’t i a woman, too?”: toxic black 
femininity, normalized transphobia, and black trans* women’s safety
 ■sunahtah jones, university of south florida
during discussions regarding the 
pervasiveness of transphobia, especially in the context of how it affects black trans* women, toxic black masculinity is largely interrogated because black trans* women are mostly attacked and murdered by black cisgender men (hunter & robinson, 2018). however, the roles that black cisgender women and toxic femininity play in the violent and systematic subjugation of black trans* women is largely ignored. i will be analyzing the ubiquity of transphobia within, but not exclusive to, black-american communities, as well as the relationships between toxic black femininity, normalized transphobia, and high rates of violence against black trans* women.
cisgender existence in a postmodern world? 
using queer and trans studies to trouble  a category
 ■samuel z. shelton, oregon state university
given that postmodernity is 
characterized by slippages or the ongoing disruption of essentialist identity categories, the conceptualization of “cisgender” may threaten to undermine queer political projects by trapping us in the calcifying and reductive logics of modernity. if we recognize gender as a shifting set of political relations rather than merely an internal reality, then trans and cisgender existence cannot be distinguished solely on the basis of movement in or against the gender binary as everyone is in a state of perpetual motion. maintaining this artificial distinction may threaten to undermine trans liberation movements and feminist imaginings of just futures.
problematizing sexual orientation: beyond the 
cisnormative conflations of sex and gender172
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: saturday, november 10 ■emerson parker pehl, widener university
there has been little interrogation of the 
actual definition of sexual orientation, namely is the attraction to gender or is it to sex, more specifically, to genitalia? since sexual orientation is still rooted in conflating and dichotomous notions of gender and sex it becomes inherently marginalizing to trans and intersex people since their personhood is either reduced to their genitalia and/or a historical ignorance to the existence of ambiguous genitalia is perpetuated. additionally, the concept of sexual orientation not only revolves around gender and/or sex, but specifically how bodies make sexual contact, which emphasizes genital pleasure through genital-to-genital contact.

queer kinship and “the refugee crisis”: 
contesting the racial and sexual discourses of family in canadian refugee sponsorship
 ■natalie kouri-towe, concordia university
over the past two years, canada’s 
refugee sponsorship initiative, #welcomerefugees, has captured public interest, particularly through stories in the media that feature the intimate relationships that develop between refugees and their sponsors. investigating how kinship is deployed, contested, and shaped in these stories by normative, hetero-patriarchal, and racial formations of the family in canada’s sponsorship program, this talk proposes a re-envisioning of responses to “the refugee crisis” through queer theories of kinship.
the “migration crisis” and the social imaginary 
of bordering
 ■leila whitley, university of california,  
san diego
in the context of what is understood 
as a “migration crisis” in europe, the mediterranean sea has become both a site of tragedy and of intense focus. this paper examines the relationship between focus on this space, and transit across it, and the production of social imaginaries of bodies as in and out of place within europe. it argues for the significance of the body for theories of borders and bordering – a body that is, to a large extent, lacking in much current border studies scholarship – by drawing on feminist and critical race theory.
the syrian refugees are here, and they are 
struggling – now what?
 ■gada mahrouse, concordia university
the arrival of syrian refugees to the west 
has prompted countless informal and grassroots solidarity groups, initiatives and programs offering basic supports and services. a successful subset of these programs are food-related, collective kitchen initiatives that invites refugee women to prepare and sell meals. using collective kitchen examples as case-studies, this paper brings together insights from critical humanitarian and transnational feminist theories to examine how the these initiatives help to represent refugees differently.
from refugee protection to double punishment: 
examining the institutional production of immigration penality
 ■nora butler burke, concordia university
trans women refugees in canada 
are frequent targets of criminal law enforcement, and are commonly ensnared in a nexus of double punishment - subjected to both criminal and immigration penality. this paper examines immigration penality through the institutional texts that coordinate the work of immigration and border control agents, and situates these texts in conversation with migrant trans women’s own encounters with law enforcement. drawing on feminist legal theory, this paper reflects on methodological approaches to research and advocacy at the intersections of refugee protection and immigration penality.

lessons from women-led nonviolent campus 
actions against sexual assault
 ■domale keys, university of california,  
los angeles
the recent #metoo movement reminds 
us that one in four to five women experience some form of sexual violence during college (fisher et al. 2000), a manifestation of what the nonviolent strategist rev. james m. lawson jr. terms plantation capitalism (sharma, 2016) on college campuses. as women have long used nonviolent organizing to address concerns (codur and king, 2015), this study analyzes nonviolent actions women students employed at two college campuses between 2013-2017 to curb levels of sexual assault. it concludes with ways campus groups can better target the sources of power at institutions to make lasting change.
sexual violence at canadian universities: 
an intersectional analysis of policies and prevention efforts

this paper reflects on the preliminary 
findings of a qualitative research project that critically analyzes how sexual violence is conceptualized in policies and prevention efforts at selected canadian universities through an intersectional feminist framework. specifically, this paper seeks to explore whether and how the experiences of those who are typically marginalized in mainstream research and responses to violence are reflected in conceptualizations of sexual violence and the prevention efforts that they inform within these institutional cultures.

an (incomplete) feminist history of  
‘call-out culture.’
 ■kiera anderson, simon fraser university
in response to subtheme three, this 
paper explores how feminists have used ‘call-outs’ as an insurgent form of knowledge production; by sharing stories of abuse and warn others about predatory or abusive individuals. i examine how feminists in the 1990’s and early 2000’s used online and offline media in tandem to share stories of abuse and warn others about predatory or abusive individuals. i consider how race, class, gender identity and sexual orientation have affected the nature and visibility of particular call-outs, and how call-outs have also been weaponized to target marginalized individuals.

this paper builds on maría lugones’s 
efforts (2008) to bring into conversation bodies of scholarship that have remained largely disconnected: indigenous feminist thought in north america and decolonial feminist scholarship from latin america. to do so, i read the work of leanne betasamosake simpson (michi saagug nishnaabeg) (201 1, 2017) in light of lugones’s understanding of resistant subjectivities (2003, 2008, 2010), asking to what extent simpson’s ideas about resurgence vis-à-vis colonial dispossession resonate with lugones’s notions of decolonial feminism and de-coloniality. i also consider what any dissimilarities indicate about the contingency of resistance in relation to history, geography and sociopolitical context.
sending out the call: the black woman 
(1970) and the futures of black  feminist intersubjectivity
 ■kimberly lamm, duke university
within the subtheme of “revolutions and 
utopian projects: sustained, incomplete, and derailed,” this paper explores toni cade bambara’s 1970 anthology the black woman as a multi-layered manifesto that calls out to black women to take up creative and poetic practices as crucial forms of political intervention. i am particularly interested in how the anthology addresses women of color to create and participate in revolutionary literary texts that fragment and interrupt fantasmatic images of black women in the white patriarchal imagination and thereby open spaces that allow for the unpredictable play of sameness and difference that intersubjectivity names.
the mutual comradeship of w.e.b. du bois 
and radical black women
 ■charisse burden-stelly, carleton college
this paper explores a phenomenon 
i call “mutual comradeship” during w.e.b. du bois’ “radical period,” which spans roughly 1935-1963. it explicates the ways in which du bois inspired a generation of leftist black women to struggle against antiblackness, colonialism, imperialism, fascism, racist misogyny, and war-women who in turn motivated, supported, and defended dubois in his latter, more militant years. these women’s protracted engagement with socialism, communism, pacifism, pan-africanism, and black internationalism, influenced, and were influenced by, dr. du bois.
the other side of chaos: black and 
indigenous futurity, possibility and solidarity ■derrika hunt, university of california, berkeley
this paper imagines futurity beyond

(wilderson 2010; sexton, 2014) we aim to explore the linkages between black women’s epistemologies and native women’s epistemologies to locate possibilities of futurity, revolution and freedom-making. we are taking up the santa cruz women of color cluster’s profound question: how do we build on the edges of each others struggles? how do we black and native american women come together to articulate a black-native project of freedom-making. we want to imagine a new grammar, lexicon, and ultimately  
 a new language.

reinventing the feminist strike. reading the

 ■miriam tola, northeastern university
from argentina to poland to italy and 
the us, feminists have been going on strike. this paper looks at how the italian feminist movement non una di meno has been reinventing the strike in a context characterized by labor precarization and the racist instrumentalization of violence against women. it shows that a strike born against gender violence has been expressing a constituent potential, that is, the urgency to radically reconfigure broader social relations. in this sense, the paper reads the feminist strike as a revolutionary practice that interrogates established notions of revolution.

articulates “debility” as a framework to understand how racialized bodies are “worn down” by the biopolitical state, even when doing so fails to result in formal disablement. this paper considers “correction” as a biopolitical mechanism for debilitation and capacity-building. i argue that disability precedes both debility and capacity-building when debilitation is enacted through “correctional” facilities and when capacity is increased through “corrective” technologies like “cyborg” prosthetics and prenatal genetic diagnosis. the state’s “right to correct,” then, may be read as a mode to render all disabled bodies docile within debilitated or capacative statuses.

 modes of resistance that are contingent

contemplative practices (yoga, meditation, free writing) invite us to keep our hearts open as we reckon with multiple injustices. these practices offer a witness for experiences people have buried, welcome silence and movement, and see justice as key to our survival. contemplative practices allow us to rethink our relationship to grading, office hours, desks, and faculty meetings. 178

cultivating feminist contemplative practices 
in the wgst research classroom
 ■michele tracy berger, university of north 
california at chapel hill
this paper explores the author’s four 
year involvement bridging feminist contemplative practice approaches in a variety of classroom and research endeavors. using a case study approach, she draws on her experience training college students in contemplative approaches and how to apply them in research settings. she will highlight her work through an inter-institutional collaboration researching the mental and physical health effects on at-risk middle school children, mostly girls of color, who participate in an after school yoga program. she will share lesser known pedagogical tools that support contemplative and embodied approaches in the classroom.
feminist contemplative pedagogy: critical 
self-discovery and the work of social justice
 ■leeray costa, hollins university
this paper explores the ways that critical 
feminist approaches to epistemology, embodiment, and self-reflection can be enhanced and experienced via the use of contemplative practices in women’s studies classrooms from the intro level to senior seminar. informed by gloria anzaldúa’s concepts of spiritual activism and conocimiento (2002, 2015) and bell hooks’ praxis of “bonding across boundaries” (2013), i invite students to practice silence, deep listening, “horizontal inquiry” (snowber 2016), autoethnography, and yoga (and more) as processes of self-discovery and critical vigilance necessary to recognize and intervene into systems of inequality and injustice, and to build solidarity across difference.

is a task in itself - to try and prove that a muslim woman can be funny is a little bit... trickier. having had a pretty unique upbringing, and having dealt with a good bit of adversity, i used this term project to do a comedy routine titled “i don’t eat pork” that discusses my own intersectional experiences as a muslim woman, deflates some common stereotypes and assumptions, and sneaks in some feminism for good measure.

viette is a 2012 feature length 
independent film about domestic violence in the refugee family. this largely uncirculated amateur film captures the violent experiences of intergenerational clash, intimate partner violence and mental illness. rather than subjecting ourselves to the violence on screen, i suggest that unwatchability as a form of gendered and racialized spectatorship, privileges emotion as an ethical response to explore the social and historical legacies of racism, empire and the vietnam war as structures of domination which underlie the intimate violence depicted in the film.

imagining resilience: the making of world(s)

 ■alix olson, university of

the feminist film mad max depicts 
our “capitalocene’s” apocalyptic conclusion: a slave infrastructure, providing blood, testosterone and mothers’ milk, sustains the elite on a corroded planet. meanwhile, in actual response to earth’s increasing fragility, nasa has confirmed its mission to colonize mars and render humans an interplanetary species. this paper thinks with these dystopian scenarios in which responding to human vulnerability paradoxically entails extending the contemporary socio-political order. in particular, i consider competing imaginaries of “resilience” at work in scientific claims that another world is possible (and necessary) and in feminist (science fiction) calls to remake the one we inhabit.

authorizing violence at the nexus of 
liberalism, warfare, and the human
 ■taylor wondergem, university of california, 
santa cruzthis paper asks how the state enacts 
and authorizes violence across different modalities of warfare, situating war not just as killing but as forging the human into a particular form. by different modalities of warfare, i mean to take seriously the “war” of those projects of uplift in which the state exercises violence through and within a promise to secure the public good or preserve lift. this analysis suggests that social projects of uplift and militarily waged warfare work to (re)produce sylvia wynter’s overrepresentated man as biocentric as it purports to be primarily social.

 ■dana t. ahern, university of california-

women of color and a praxis of inclusivity: 
exploring the experiential and affective push and pull of those who do
 ■sarah schlessinger, long island  
university brooklyn
inclusive education has remained 
elusive, in part, because it is ideologically at odds with audit cultures that govern schooling practices (author, 2017) and which contribute to the circulation of an affective push away from difference, failure, and deviant bodies often associated with disability (thomson, 2017) and subsequently attached to inclusive education.  this paper is a narrative inquiry into the affective attachments of women of color teaching in special education and their commitment to pursue inclusive praxis and negotiate the complex spaces of exclusionary schooling as mediated by their own narratives and  lived experiences.

daring to transgress: christiane taubira’s

 ■brigitte marti, 50 50 magazine
christiane taubira epitomizes the 
contradictions of the postcolonial french society with her unapologetic blackness as a french woman. her social and political engagement is marked by her own evolution from a french guyanese independent activist to becoming a strong supporter of the republican pact and minister of justice in the hollande’s administration. in her text, “nous habitons la terre” (we inhabit the earth), i will demonstrate how christiane taubira’s radical imaginary and her political position intersect with her literary talent “to create space for traditionally marginalized communities in both french historical and contemporary society.”

moving the impossible: the black fugitive 
movement in puerto rican feminist literature
 ■judith rodriguez, university of

this paper centers the aesthetic and 
political move to blacken the puerto rican literary imaginary by feminist and queer writers. in doing so, these authors gesture toward a novel, yet established feminist literary movement that is driven by and indebted to the historical formations of gender and sexuality within the plantation regimes and cultures of racial slavery and its after-life in puerto rico. this paper, therefore, turns to the african diaspora and its iterations of blackness as they are performed within the queer and feminist labor of puerto rican women writers in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: saturday, november 10this paper will consider n.k. jemisin’s 
broken earth trilogy in light feminist theologian catherine keller’s suggestion that our “apocalyptic habit,” while politically useful, may also inevitably be “self-an/nihil/ating,” as a replication of western religion’s creatio ex nihilo and erasure of interrelationship at “the beginning.” jemisin, while crafting characters that are intimately connected to apocalypse and its promises, will ultimately challenge us to redirect the dualism created in such projections and their praxes. the series exemplifies keller’s notion of “counter-apocalypse:” a counter-power that works to diffract apocalyptic power while preserving interrelationship with apocalypse  and with what we would  ‘have apocalypsed.’

sociological worlding in apocalyptic times
 ■ginna husting, boise state university
the sociological imagination, 
fundamentally concerned with analysis of systemic inequalities, almost exclusively creates models of “what it is against” rather than ‘what it is for.’ distrustful of praxis, sociologists tend to eschew two kinds of knowledge that can expand and strengthen it; critical indigenous studies and afro-futurist/feminist science fiction. this paper argues that a new sociological imagination can and must emerge, and must take seriously a sociology of becoming.’ sociological knowledge can illuminate/imagine forms of social organization that minimize/mute inequality, hierarchies of value, and suffering. ultimately sociology can learn from and inform the worldings of feminist/afrofuturist sf and indigenous studies.
decolonial digital belongings in israel-palestine

queer indigenous scholars such as andrea smith have called for a queering of indigenous studies and an indigeneity of queer theory, calling for a critical “politics of futurity.” this paper examines this call in light of jose esteban munoz’s notion of queer futurity and hannah arendt’s notions of plurality and power as collective action.

afrofuturism, critical indigenous theory, decolonial posthumanism—all of these theoretical landscapes, and others, overlap in their attempts to imagine transnational futures that embrace the fluidity of subjectivity, an ethics of becoming, and the potential to remake power. working from the speculative indigenous fictions of leanne simpson, the afrofuturism of nnedi okorafor, the transnational feminism of shashi deshpande, and the decolonial science fiction of nalo hopkinson, we can revision theories of the posthuman from rosi braidotti or donna haraway; we can realign concepts of biopolitics with contemporary global power relations, and we can rework theory/activism affiliations across geographic and ideological borders.

animal execution and bestial lust
 ■gabriel rosenberg, duke university
in the early modern atlantic world, 
bestiality was a capital offense. authorities executed not only human offenders but also the animals with which humans had copulated. this paper examines cases of animal execution to understand the contours and meanings of “crimes against nature.” animal executions reflected a cultural recognition of animal culpability and desire, and courts often treated animals as amorous conspirators rather than victims. the paper contrasts this with contemporary obsessions with “animal innocence,” and argues that the erasure of animal desire works to naturalize the catastrophic political ecology of late capitalism.

 ■anna watkins fisher, university of michigan
this paper examines performances by 
núria güell and kenneth pietrobono that document the artists’ efforts to find within the law a means to repudiate it. in stateless by choice (2015), güell struggles to abdicate her spanish nationality and become stateless; in easement (2016), pietrobono attempts to reclassify private property as unowned. while she grapples with nationality inherited by “right of blood” (jus sanguinis), pietrobono (who was born undocumented) explores nationality as earned by “right of the soil” (jus soli). encountering legal red tape, these artists model feminist performances that turn the paternalism of the state into a kind of loophole.

“a drama of accumulation’: besieged

 ■alex pittman, barnard college
this presentation traces a feminist 
critique of racial capitalism within the practice of suzan-lori parks’s black feminist theater. in particular, it analyzes the middle of parks’s imperceptible mutabilities in the third kingdom (1989), where abduction and hospitality, as well as enslavement and liberation, are enmeshed in the body and life of a dying black female domestic worker. as it explores the aesthetics of embodiment in this staging of late capitalist living and dying, this paper argues that parks’s feminist theatrical work transforms some ascendant interpretive frameworks of marxist cultural critique, particularly accumulation and abstraction.

black on both sides identifies multiple 
intersections between blackness and transness from the mid-nineteenth century to present-day anti-black and anti-trans legislation and violence. the book takes as its archive an eclectic collection of materials, including late 19th century sexological texts, plantation medical records, fugitive slave narratives, afro-modernist literary productions, documentary films, and mid-twentieth century journalistic accounts of black trans people and critically engaging black queer studies, black feminist theory, disability theory, and transgender studies, the book demonstrates how race figures prominently in the development of the category of transgender. and how blackness finds articulation in and through transness. reconstructing these theoretical and historical trajectories furthers our imaginative capacities to conceive more livable black and  
trans worlds.

this roundtable addresses the interplay 
between insurgent activism and conservative backlash in two western states; in doing so, we will draw larger conclusions about the future of progressive organizing efforts when they are marooned in predominantly white, conservative milieus. in arizona, we examine anti-ethnic studies and anti-immigration legislation, along with racialized framings of human trafficking. next, we explore the contested space(s) of wyoming equality and the possibilities of generating new knowledge production from contradictory positionalities in radical queer organizing. panelists proffer thoughts on continuing challenges to feminist organizing and to (re)imagining justice under regional/sociopolitical pressures in the american west/southwest.

“love is love”: race and queer friendship in 
the young adult fiction of jacqueline woodson
 ■kristen proehl, the college at brockport
this paper explores representations 
of inter- and intra-racial friendships between girls in jacqueline woodson’s african american coming-of-age novels, hush, another brooklyn, and i hadn’t meant to tell you. ya literature often turns to same-sex friendship to critique institutions of heterosexuality and challenge racial, gender, and class hierarchies. woodson’s texts follow in this tradition, as they not only interrogate the privileging of biological and romantic ties over friendship but also demonstrate how sexism and heterosexism contribute to inequality. her representations of friendship disrupt the binary of romantic and platonic love, confront masculine violence, and situate friendship as a vehicle of protest.
“a proustian moment:” re-capturing girlhood 
in alison bechdel’s fun home
 ■rachael mulvihill, the college at brockport
alison bechdel’s novel fun home is 
an autobiographical, tragic comic that challenges a normative expectation of sexuality through the recapturing of bechdel’s childhood. this paper discusses how bechdel counters these expectations by comparing her comic to marcel proust’s novel in search of lost time. in proust’s novel the narrator focuses on social status, love and art as the three revenues that influence a person’s adulthood. i use these categories to contend that bechdel’s girlhood and sexuality were stilted until she was able to separate her autonomy from her father’s patriarchal and forced heterosexual influence.
crafting a community of consent, healing, 
and joy in sarah j. maas’ ya series a court of thorns and roses
 ■laura d’amore, roger williams university
a court of thorns and roses, by sarah 
j. maas, is a young adult fantasy series of novels wherein 19-year-old feyre archeron finds herself trapped in an unhealthy relationship. when she is given a safe harbor to a new community, she has the space to reconcile the trauma that she has endured. this paper argues that the book series is, at its core, about agency, consent, and female sexual pleasure. girl readers who find their way to this book series are offered a journey of healing and joy, and a vision of the power of sexual agency and exploration.

performativity of justice: solidarity 
campaigns with angela davis in europe
 ■jamele watkins, stanford university
my paper conceptualizes transnational 
solidarity with angela davis during her 1970 – 1972 trial. for the project, i draw from a recently uncovered archive that stanford university recently began processing. at the archival processing center, i examine letters and petitions sent to the marin county courthouse from across europe. using this ephemera, i answer the following questions: how do the petitions differ from country to country? how do these petitions disrupt the archive? how does performative solidarity manifest in letters and petitions from across europe? analyzing this collection, i demonstrate that letter writing and petition signing were affective performative acts.
fugitive archives: critical fabulation in 
shailja patel’s migritude
 ■neelofer qadir, university of

in this paper, i show how shailja 
patel’s migritude fractures the sanitized history of kenyan independence. she refashions a normative gift – a trousseau of saris, which she uses as props – into an interwoven and multivalent movement narrative that juxtaposes the colonial archive with her family’s story as well as kikuyu and maasai women’s oral 186

felt history: literary form as geopolitical 
archive in cristina garcia’s dreaming in cuban
 ■lauren silber, wesleyan university
this paper considers cristina garcia’s 
1992 novel, dreaming in cuban, a saga that follows the lives of three-generations of a cuban family during the twentieth century. i contend that garcia’s use of the family saga as literary form coheres disparate political and filial attachments experienced by each character, exposing continuities of trauma and racialization across generations while constructing an alternative archive of cubanness that ruptures the unilateral narratives of cuba perpetuated by what jodi kim calls the ‘cold war epistemology.’ in this way, i show how garcia, through literary form, situates the family at the center of geopolitical history.
revolutionary or terrorist? fiction as counter-
archive in giannina braschi’s united states of banana
 ■samina gul ali, university of miami
my paper examines giannina braschi’s 
201 1 novel united states of banana in tandem with 1960s fbi files on “terrorist” black and puerto rican groups in new york city and nypd surveillance files on muslim communities after 9/1 1. i juxtapose nypd/fbi documents with fiction to consider how “official” archives criminalize populations of color and “work to justify policing practices, deportation policies, and increased incarceration” (cacho 2012). i analyze braschi’s re-appropriation of the language in these state-sanctioned documents to explore protagonist giannina’s struggle for puerto rican independence and transnational solidarity with those affected by the war on terror.343. alternatives in publishing: a

for transnational feminist scholars, there 
is perhaps no greater tension than that between the desire to make a difference socially and politically and the need to fulfill the research obligations of academia. moreover, there continues to be a critical need for feminist scholars to advance public knowledge and debate by bringing women’s studies and feminist scholarship to a mass audience in the u.s. and globally. in this writing workshop, editors of a feminist magazine, along with scholars across disciplines who have published in feminist and mainstream media, will discuss alternative possibilities for publication in the popular press.

scholars of economics, comparative education, rhetoric, and transnational girlhoods who have individually and collectively troubled the ways poor, racialized girls’ lives in the global south are routinely instrumentalized in the service of global economic restructuring. inspired to move beyond critique and “imagine the impossible,” we ask: what are the parameters of possibility beyond the edict to “invest in girls” as “smart economics”? can the radical potential of girls’ empowerment be reclaimed outside corporate development regimes? if so, how might we imagine “girls in development” as a paradigm that challenges neoliberal capitalist formations of empire?

microaggressions are all too common 
in academia for students, faculty, and staff. they target persons with disabilities, people of color, women, and members of other minority groups. because of their nature—commonplace verbal or behavioral indignities whether intentional or unintentional—recognizing and responding to microaggressions can be difficult. in this workshop, we will elicit participants’ experiences with microaggressions, reflect on the harm done, and generate practices that will work within the current state of affairs to minimize harm and work toward an environment for knowledge production that respects all knowers.

 ■rochelle harris cox, kennesaw  
state universityspeaker one will use the postcolonial 
gothic and museum studies to complicate individual remembering and its ability to interrupt and be in conversation with cultural memorialization. in the context of a place-based creative nonfiction piece set in georgia, the speaker examines a theoretical and aesthetic framework that allows this genre to grapple with the hauntings of indigenous genocide, civil war, class tensions, and (gendered) personal experiences. reading excerpts from the essay, the speaker shares strategies for imagining this textual work as within, without, and complicating the aesthetics of memory work and the public history narratives.

grassroots transnational rhetorics: memory 
work in wangari maathai’s unbowed.
 ■virginia crisco, california state

speaker three analyzes the global 
feminist and environmental rhetoric of wangari maathi, founder of the green belt movement and winner of the 2004 nobel peace prize, through her memoir unbowed. maathi’s life’s work focused on helping women in poverty help themselves through the planting of 30 million trees over 25 years. this presentation draws on maathai’s memoir to argue for her contribution to what royster and kirsch call a “transnational construction[] of rhetorical enterprise[]” (loc 1502), rhetorical practices that inform a global feminist movement for peace, sustainability, grassroots democracy, and women’s empowerment.348. transnational feminist solidarities:

feminist solidarity & “dissident friendships”: 
the path to peace and security in south asia?
 ■meera sehgal, carleton college
since the mid-1980s, in the shadow 
of neoliberal globalization, virulent nationalisms fueled by religious rightwing politics, an unprecedented arms race, and war, a transnational feminist network called sangat has quietly taken root in south asia. sangat is a network of feminist “troublemakers” who have refused to submit to the given reality of nation-state boundaries and conflict in south asia, and who have dared to propose (and practice) feminist “love and friendship” as a viable and alternative path to peace and security in the region. this paper focuses on sangat’s utopian project, examining its methods, achievements, challenges and limitations.
fragile transnational feminist discourse in iran
 ■ladan zarabadi, university of cincinnati
addressing subtheme 5, this paper explores iranian feminist movements in the 2010s, focusing on the period since the last presidential election in spring 2017 . i argue that the interactions between women inside iran and activists beyond the borders of iran have shaped and strengthened the iranian women’s movement. drawing on transnational feminist approaches, such as those offered by breny mendoza and richa nagar, i use the recent feminist movement in iran as a case study to examine the inevitability of solidarities among feminists across and beyond iranian borders and to problematize the inside/outside binary system in transnational feminist discourse.

emergence of “queerocrats” in the international development and human rights industry by examining strategies employed by lgbtqia* individuals within multilateral institutions and civil society to make their work and workplaces queer. illustrated by interviews with “queerocrats” (inspired by eisenstein’s [1996] use of the term “femocrat”) at united nations agencies, the world bank, global affairs canada, usaid, and ngos, my research investigates how lgbtqia* individuals move and shake (with constraint) from within bureaucracies.

re-imagining the irish nation: abortion and 
the gendered politics of shame
 ■clara fischer, university college dublin
the history of postcolonial nation-
building in ireland needs to be read through the prism of the gendered politics of shame. women’s reproduction and sexuality became tightly, affectively regulated throughout the early decades of the newly independent irish nation-state, and several policy issues in contemporary ireland reflect this, including the long-standing abortion ban. following a referendum set for may this year, which is designed to eliminate constitutional obstacles to a more liberal abortion regime in ireland, this paper asks what the referendum result can tell us about a newly imagined ireland and the role of gendered shame therein.
unpacking the regulation of sex laws 
through shame in contemporary india
 ■namrata mitra, iona college
sex laws in india are based on specific 
conceptions of shame and gender. in the context of sexual violence laws, the harm of assault is often understood as shame or loss of honor. one of its many effects has, therefore, been differential access to rape laws for women based on whether the police and the courts deem them “pure,” or “fallen,” or outside of this dichotomy altogether. another instance is that of re-criminalization of non- procreative sex acts and lgbtq identites. in this paper, i demonstrate the harm of such legal frameworks, and look towards resources for change.
not just “bad sex”: normative gender and 
sexual violence
 ■dianna taylor, john carroll university
the #metoo movement has generated 
an overall ambivalent social response. men’s and women’s behavior, as well as women’s accusations, are being defended, criticized, and denounced. taking the aziz ansari case as representative of the social ambivalence toward #me too, this paper argues that not only behavior like ansari’s, but also the overall social ambivalence toward it, reflect and in turn reproduce what nicola gavey describes as the normative “cultural scaffolding of rape.” the paper thus illustrates both why such behavior is not benign and why, given normative gendered power relations, it may nonetheless be experienced and viewed as such.354. disrupting patriarchal borders:

before they were ecologically noble savages: 
gendered representations of amazonian peoples and nature in the 1970s
 ■sarah sarzynski, claremont mckenna college
this paper uses gender as a category 
of analysis to show the prevailing representations of the amazon and its people on the eve of the “decade of destruction.” 1970s discourses set the stage for the wave of environmental campaigns to “save the rain forest” that developed in the 1980s and 1990s. while most representations drew upon well-established tropes of the amazon as a “green hell,” an el dorado, and amazonian indians as cannibal savages, a gendered analysis of popular culture demonstrates challenges to the white male explorer-as-hero trope even though amazon continued to be portrayed as a sexually perverse space.

towards a kinship of viruses
 ■timothy gitzen, indiana university
this paper ethnographically explores 
biosecurity and the discursive emergence of an anti-lgbt aids-middle east respiratory syndrome “super virus” in south korea. specifically, i bring the practice of biosecurity to bear on idioms of life and kinship. by queering biosecurity, i argue that the kinship between these two viruses allows for a reassessment of life at the level of the microbial (helmreich 2009, 2016). queer activists are at the forefront of this transformation, actively embodying categories of contamination and biological unruliness to challenge the “reproductive futurism” (edelman 2004) implicit in korean idioms of kinship and biosecurity practice.queer haitian ecologies: the trash church

organizations partnered with haitians in the wake of the 2010 earthquake to address “homophobia” and “transphobia” in relief and recovery work. these organizations did not consider how these terms might shift in a necropolitial landscape of u.s. imperialism. this paper draws on a decade of ethnographic research with same-sex desiring and gender creative haitians to queerly rethink conditions of harm, debilitation, and disablement. i draw on black queer feminist scholarship—vanessa agard-jones on body burden and omise’eke tinsley on queer haitian femme labor—to center haitian strategies for imagining justice in toxic landscapes of plastic, trash,  and chemicals.
metronormativity and gay rights in the trump 
era: re-thinking the matthew shepard story
 ■carly thomsen, middlebury college
in the twenty years since matthew 
shepard’s death in laramie, wyoming, the cultural narratives surrounding the case rarely have been questioned. shepard was—the story goes—killed by rural homophobes. in 2013, journalist stephen jimenez troubled this account, suggesting shepard’s murder was linked to methamphetamine, rather than homophobia. gay rights activists responded with outrage. i argue that jimenez’s provocative discussion creates new possibilities for challenging metronormativity, and in so doing, expands common conceptions of what constitutes contemporary lgbtq issues and politics—a crucial intervention in this moment in which liberals have tethered trump’s election to (ostensibly homophobic) rural america.
lesbian imaginings and interventions: new 
theorizations of masculinities and violence in south africa
 ■amanda swarr, university of washingtonsouth africa has gained global attention 
for what are represented as violent forms of masculinity and “corrective” rapes of lesbians, whereby black lesbians are targeted and punished for their masculinities and sexual relationships with women. but less well-known are the complexities of political responses to and theorizations of gender and violence. drawing on two decades of work with activists in the region, this paper will analyze how lesbian activists unsettle men’s exclusive claims to masculinities and foreground the ways that their work imagines and facilitates new conceptions of gender and social change.

tech security, racial capitalism, and  
feminist fugitivity
 ■stephanie murphy, university of arizona
a silicon valley startup, anduril 
industries, has proposed to build a virtual wall on the us-mexico border. these recent events speak to the way tech capital ventures collude with militarized nationalism to generate new topographies of security and new surveillance economies (fuchs 2013). i contextualize this virtual wall project in a long arc of technologized security and racial capitalism and speculate as to how automation recalibrates labor in this moment (clough 201 1). lastly, i consider what feminist strategies are available to challenge this constellation in the service of what fred moten and others have called “fugitivity” (moten and  rowell 2004).
debt forgiveness: the chronicle of higher

imagining a world without houseworkers
 ■elizabeth verklan, cottey college
in her canonical feminist text, women, race, & class, angela davis asserted that “housework…may finally be approaching historical obsolescence” (davis 1981). as the tech industry heralds robotic technologies that aim to “liberate” humans from “women’s work,” it simultaneously calls for a universal income. i engage materialist feminist scholarship in order to think about the promise(s) of universal income: what are its feminist legacies? (james 1972; federici 2012; weeks 201 1). what are the limits- and possibilities- to this economic praxis? what does it mean for those whose livelihoods- already made precarious by the logics of racial capitalism- will become obsolete?

 ■mary jean hande, university of manitoba
in this presentation, i examine the 
emergence of revolutionary disability consciousness in anti-gentrification and activist harm reduction work in toronto’s “downtown east end,” a stigmatized inner-city neighbourhood. drawing on three years of research with toronto service providers and anti-poverty activists, i use rachel gorman’s (2016) disability/disablement dialectic as an analytic to historicize and materialize the terrain of radical disability struggles and demonstrate the centrality of disabled people on the frontlines of urban anti-gentrification and harm reduction struggles. this analysis also expands understandings of disability that exceed mainstream disability movements and helps develop a revolutionary disability futurity.
a step toward a conceptualization of

 ■sona kazemi, university of toronto
through this project, i studied the iran-
iraq war and the resulting production of disabled bodies, analyzed in a dialectical and historical materialist framework. this article comprises a report of the case study and a new conceptualization of disability theory from a transnational perspective. as a war survivor middle eastern woman, through the case study, i examine the social relations behind the production of disabled bodies in the war, while exploring the processes by which people became and remained disabled. finally, using the case study, i develop an  
anti-racist, anti-imperialist, anti-nationalist, and non-ideological mode of inquiry for understanding disability and disablement.
re-imagining kurdish women’s resistance

this paper narrates and contextualizes 
real-life stories of incarceration, torture, and hunger strike that has resulted in permanent disability in the period between the military coup of september 12, 1980 and 1984 in turkey. as a kurdish woman political prisoner, i reveal the processes such as “turkification” and incarceration and social relations such as nationalism, patriarchy, capitalism and imperialism behind the incarceration of kurdish women through a reflexive/relational analysis of their experiences. through this analysis, i examine how prison, as site of punishment, has been transformed and re-imagined by kurdish women political prisoner’s into a site of learning, resistance, and struggle.

a mother’s place is in the struggle: 
transnational mothers’ labor as a site  of radical politics
 ■valerie francisco-menchavez, san francisco 
state university
unpaid labor of migrant mothers (from 
abroad) and their paid labor as care workers are structured by demands of global pull for domestics and neoliberal conditions of joblessness in their home countries. the labor of migrant mothers in both their paid and unpaid domestic work can produce a critique of public and private patriarchal oppression through racialized and classed devaluation. i present evidence that the labor in mothering—tasks such as transnational coordination of house duties, and localized duties as a nannies or housekeepers—can produce a gendered consciousness regarding the debasement of the critical work of domestic labor.
paid mother and unpaid mother: reproductive 
labor in the transnational korean assisted reproductive technology (art) industry
 ■sunhye kim, harvard university
this paper examines how the concept of 
reproductive labor has been contested, negotiated, and reconstructed by intended mothers and gestational surrogates in the transnational korean art industry. while the notion of surrogacy as labor has been widely debated, the reproductive labor performed by intended mothers tends to be overlooked. however, intended mothers’ labor should also be considered “reproductive labor” along with paid surrogates. by analyzing the everyday experiences of korean intended mothers and ukrainian surrogates as they participate in the baby-making process together, this paper aims to reevaluate reproductive labor as a central key to understanding the lucrative art industry.

transnational adoption is often described 
as “win-win” for both prospective parents as well as for children to meet their needs of building a family and finding one, respectively. and yet, its necessary condition involves, first and foremost, birth mothers’ reproductive dispossession. aiming toward a global reproductive justice framework, this paper brings birth mothers as a center of analysis

decolonial futures: mapping a cartography of

 ■sandra c. alvarez, chapman university
the u’wa nation, located in present-day 
colombia, offer decolonial options for the future. using my perspective as an activist researcher enmeshed in long-term organizational and personal relationships with u’wa leaders, i map a cartography of struggle as a decolonial feminist methodology that traces relationships across time, land and species. the resulting multidimensional mapping of the u’wa struggle looks towards the future by weaving the past to the present, the u’wa to the americas, and humans to the land on which we live. in learning from indigenous theory and practice, this mapping practice challenges dominant political science frameworks.imagining radical futures of space and place
 ■elisabeth paquette, university of north 
carolina at charlotte
mapping, or how a given terrain is 
organized, exemplifies the importance of bridging the divide between the natural and social sciences due to the colonial implications (both historical and contemporary) that such projects often entail. in this paper, i offer an analysis of mapping through the works of sylvia wynter and michel foucault. i propose that such an analysis and the implications for settler colonialism therein, when paired with the writings of indigenous theorists and sci-fi writers, provide the conditions for imagining indigenous futures of space and place.
material crisis of indigeneity: a rhetorical 
ecofeminist critique of trump’s land  use policies
 ■megan o’byrne, kutztown university
in 2017 donald trump reduced 
bears ears national monument to eight-five percent of its original obama era acreage. from a critical rhetorical ecofeminist viewpoint this decision materially devalued those spaces as ones unworthy of protection making them available for resource development and extraction. left to deal with the ramifications are the many native american tribes who hold these lands sacred and whose unchronicled, unstudied ancient artifacts remain in peril on the unprotected lands.
the unintended effects of carbon tax
 ■aishwarya krishna iyer, university of florida
climate change is real and is here to stay. climate change not only affects living conditions, but also tend to impose occupational constrains on people all over the globe. such consequences are not uniform. marginalized and vulnerable communities tend to face vaster consequences, thereby indicating that climate change is not only an environmental and scientific problem, but also a class and gender issue. in response, several authorities came forward proposing measures to curb and curtail carbon emissions. the present paper shall look at the class and gender implication of adopting one such measure- the levy of taxation based on co2 emissions.

ramón, radio kdna’s only woman co-founder and first station manager to develop a free, publicly accessible bilingual digital archive documenting the emergence of chicana/o community radio broadcasting. this archive collects and preserves community radio’s recordings through tools that assist in the digitization and preservation of aural artifacts, images, program guides, institutional documents, and station ephemera. as a practitioner of archivista praxis, i fuse archivist and activist practices to rethink the collective possibilities of the archive, employing the networked archive as a tool to document and create the conditions of possibility for social change.
“mi tierra, mi vida”: challenging masculinist 
readings of land and identity
 ■karen roybal, colorado college
following the lead of contemporary 
chicana scholars who collect and archive histories of chicana feminists significant to social movements of the 1960s and 1970s, i discuss the chicana feminist praxis i applied to an oral history project where i interviewed women in the land grant movement in southern colorado and new mexico. the discussion centers how ethnic mexican women’s social activism challenges patriarchal structures within the movement and it reveals how, despite the persistence of a masculine historic legacy of land struggle that defines the u.s. southwest, the women’s memories compel a new archive and gendered reading of this period.
decolonizing the archives through  
feminista praxis
 ■vanessa fonseca chavez, arizona  
state university
utilizing emma pérez’s notion of the 
decolonial imaginary and chela sandoval’s oppositional consciousness, this presentation provides a theoretical framework for decolonizing the literary archives through feminista praxis. by looking at the cultural legacies and contentions of colonialism in chicana/o literature over time, i will discuss how chicana writers have negotiated agency and erasure in literary production following the mexican-american war. chicana/o literature demonstrates intricate ties to its past and relies on past narratives and literary strategies to situate future work. however, paramount to this endeavor is an untangling unproductive colonial structures and ideologies that are antithetical to decolonial feminist praxis.

this paper explores the impact of 
traditional birth attendants (tbas) on reproductive justice in nigeria as transdisciplinary research in wgs. the approach and design employed in this research draws broadly on feminist theories, feminist activist experiences in nigeria, educational trainings related to activist work, and diverse disciplinary perspectives outside of the field of wgs. how does a wsg scholar integrate multiple theoretical and disciplinary perspectives in creating distinctively transdisciplinary research? what are the challenges and opportunities in doing such research? how may this research produce new knowledge regarding the relationship between traditional birth attendants and reproductive justice in nigeria?
a transdisciplinary integration of feminist

 ■karen bravo, texas woman’s university
this paper focuses on how engagement

that aging queer: coming out old, growing 
up trans*197
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: saturday, november 10
 ■johnathan smilges, pennsylvania  
state university
“coming out” has, in popular culture, 
long been associated with the shedding of a “closeted” self. my paper, however, draws on karen barad’s metaphor of “rebirth” to explore the experiences of old and aging trans* people, for whom relationality is essential to defining the “self” (393). exemplifying veli mitova’s observation that aging indicates a “waning capacity for self-reauthorship,” people often expect aging trans* subjects to maintain some consistency between their “closeted” and “rebirthed” selves (364). pulling together transgender theory and age studies, i offer a model of trans* subjectivity that acknowledges queer relationality even as it guards against ageism.
a queer and present future: 
intergenerational storytelling in queer  of color communities
 ■jo hsu, university of arkansas
lee edelman’s antirelational polemic 
describes queer theory as a story “of why storytelling fails” (7). in an unlikely response, this paper explores the queer potentiality of storytelling itself—examining queer cultural production as both a mode of relationality (muñoz) and a rejection of normative futurity (edelman). focusing on intergenerational autobiographies by queer-of-color communities, i explore how artists and writers establish a “politics of relation” (carrillo rowe 3) that moves across conventional boundaries of space and time, folding past and future into a present that offers a little more hope (muñoz 4) for queer existence.
pedagogical care amidst normative 
institutions: rhetorics of queer access
 ■elizabeth miller, the ohio state university
the queer as an analytical tool affords 
“critique of the normal” (rawson 41), facilitating movement toward transformative access (banks) in academia. i explore ways to queer composition classrooms through the “productive indeterminacy” of the polemic, a queer genre (rand 24). viewing pedagogy as genre makes visible curricular locations amenable to playful subversion of institutional discourses. the polemic offers a model for teaching, not for its divisive emotionality, but for its slippery movement through normative discourses and systems of logic. i imagine academic sites as locations of critique, creativity, and relationality, potentially redressing literacy normativity (pritchard) harming students in institutional contexts.

382. fat utopian futures: theorizing 
embodiment, abjection, desire and sex
11:00am - 12:15pm
room 208
the panelists of ‘fat utopian futures’ 
center the fat racialized body as a space to think about fat futurity, abjection, desire and sex (tovar, 2012; hester and walters, 2016). the question that guides this roundtable is: how does a women and queer of color framework shift the field of fat studies? (sharrell, 2016; nevins 2006) their work reimagines a praxis of radical self-love that disrupts the spatiotemporality of futurity as one that takes into consideration the past/future but does not undermine the utopic affects of a fat-positive present (hernandez 2013).

 ■pamela thoma, washington state universityco-creating radical futures: restorative 
justice in the elementary classroom
 ■melanie adley, explore! community school
when reimagining sites and spaces 
for a radical politics of knowing-making and feminist pedagogies, we need to remember the critical work to be done in public school classrooms -- in particular in elementary schools. in this presentation, i intend to reveal elementary school as a crucial time and place for a child’s relationship to institutions of power and oppression. i suggest that teachers should play not only an intervening role, but a role in co-creating healing and justice with children whose options are otherwise limited by the very institutions that claim to open doors to a brighter future.
decoding discipline: disrupting racial  
and gender hegemony inscribed school discipline practices
 ■margaret kane, university of cincinnati
radical reimagination of public 
education as a site for disruption of racial and gender hegemony is necessary for empowering and nurturing the potential of all students, especially those who educators routinely deem transgressive. this paper diagnoses the structural racialized-gender prejudice of cincinnati public schools through an examination of the disparate enactment of discipline and an analysis of how educators apply and defend harmful disciplinary practices. further, using discipline as a starting point, it articulates an alternate vision of the school that rejects racial and gender hegemonic norms, actively encourages alternate expressions of student engagement, and nurtures student potential.

that can be used to critique and resist the dominant deficit-oriented characterizations of girls of color that appear in research and educational contexts. we integrate ecological, phenomenological, and critical race feminist perspectives on development and socialization and emphasize that girls of color need to develop the competencies of resistance, resilience and critical consciousness in order to develop optimally. after presenting this model, we describe how girls in diverse contexts learn to enact these competencies and imagine social justice in diverse social contexts.
toward a pedagogy of love
 ■adriane bezusko, texas christian university
grit, growth, and resilience have redefined failure as an ennobling experience in late capitalism. these psychological traits have become part of the narrative for surviving the end of social-safety nets after the great recession and are central features of the turn to culture in education reform initiatives. this cultural turn is responsible for increased student suicides and contributes to the school to prison pipeline. in this presentation, i discuss the potential for building an anti-oppressive pedagogy based on an ethics of care and love grounded in meeting the needs of all students and mutual aid partnerships in k-16 education.
the makings of feminist schools
 ■sally nuamah, duke university
the paper first examines the inherited hostilities that girls face daily against their bodies at school. the paper then argues for the need to develop feminist schools that protect children from threats that impose a differential cost on their ability to secure equivalent achievement. these schools ask two sets of questions: first, how their policies and practices levy disparate effects on a pupil’s academic, civic, or social development. next, how can they develop strategies to respond to these imbalances and thus ensure that students attaining the same education are not subjected to differential costs based on gender, race and/or sex.384. haunting diasporas/

 ■gayatri gopinath, new york university
afropolitan’s ghosts
 ■anima adjepong, simmons college
based on ethnographic research in 
houston, texas and accra, ghana, this paper explores the ghosts that haunt black diaspora. afropolitan describes africans with ties to some tangible place on the african continent and some place in the west. it also describes a genre of literature and arts, a cultural mo(ve)ment, and an identity politics. afropolitan asserts africa as a contemporary component of black diaspora and engages (some of) the lived realities of african people. in its efforts to expand the boundaries of black diaspora to include africa(ns), afropolitan also produces its own ghosts vis-à-vis its class and sexual politics
diaspora’s negative project
 ■gina dent, university of california, santa cruz
cachoeira, brazil is a treasured node in the circuit of african diasporic travel and imagination. this small town in the interior of the state of bahia, made outsize by the presence of the irmandade de moa morte [the sisterhood of the good death], draws cultural tourists year-round and fills beyond capacity for its august festival. here/there, history relies on grids of intelligibility and forms of relation that operate recursively in the space of diaspora—in this sense, as its  negative project.
black panther: contemporary hauntings
 ■diane harriford, vassar college
photographs of lynching are a quintessential example of haunting, capturing the seared image of the person, absent their kin, abandoned and left to die; while white spectators, often whole families, treat the lynching as a picnic. the haunting that we see in lynching photographs remind us that these ghosts of abandonment are still with us. black lives matter, with its deliberate attention to self care and art offer an aesthetic beyond this haunting. a question remains about the extent to which the recent film black panther--through its treatment of historical abandonment—also contributes to an aesthetic beyond this haunting.
making mirrors: righting/writing by refugees
 ■becky thompson, simmons college
this paper examines hauntings identified in the work of refugee poets from syria, afghanistan, palestine, and elsewhere, including those still in transit, relocated, and re/unsettled. their poetry offers a poetics of belonging--to the earth, family, memories packed into backpacks--referencing those who lift their children to the sky and those whose spirits are at the bottom of the sea. “making mirrors,” which comes from nazim hikmet’s poem “some advice for those who will serve time in prison” is an active verb and a plural noun, imagistic connections that refugees create, as protest and tradition, amidst multiple hauntings.

386. the school girls deserve:  
youth driven visions and solutions  for creating safe, holistic, and affirming schools
11:00am - 12:15pm
room 215 (lcd)
too many girls and transgender, gender 
non-conforming (tgnc) youth of color are being criminalized, marginalized, and neglected because of oppressive and violent beliefs, policies, and actions in schools that ultimately push them out and render them vulnerable to significant danger and undesirable outcomes (morris, 2016; moodie-mills & mitchum, 2014). utilizing findings from our participatory action research, this workshop presents youth-centered narratives, numbers, solutions, and visionary practices that we hope will inspire critical thinking about the multitude and converging ways in which racist, sexist, classist, islamophobic, homophobic and transphobic practices marginalize girls and tgnc youth of color in their learning environments.

punishing choices: trafficking, justice and 
what it means to be free
 ■april d. j. petillo, kansas state university
blending legal ethnography, indigenous 
and critical trafficking studies, this paper interrogates carceral feminist efforts as tools of the state’s punitive criminal system. using an exploration of indian country policymaker perspectives, petillo examines how targeted trafficking discourse informed by feminist law-and-order rhetoric derails decolonial indigenous justice efforts by reifying jurisdictional coloniality in indian country, pathologizing indigenous women as victims and investing in us exceptionalism in native governance. imagining indigenous legal futurity, petillo also envisions what justice more dependent on radical freedom from targeting than capture and removal might include.
aperture of the carceral state: rape, justice 
and ethnography of the trial
 ■sameena mulla, marquette university
 ■heather hlavka, marquette university
the authors argue that the courtroom 
is a central site of power that functions under the fiction that incarceration is justice meted out according to collective wishes for social good. the state requires people to reconfigure justice and redemption through normative commitments to sexual violence that depend on gendered racializing processes. these processes are at the heart of the criminal justice system, and the center of normative commitments to rape. reproducing these norms strengthens the inequality that produces the conditions for gender-based violence. the authors use the trial as an aperture for challenging carceral logic and revealing the state’s violence.
in the crutches of law: the materialities of 
gender-based violence charges
 ■srimati basu, university of kentucky
the past year of reckoning around 
sexual assault through legal and extra-legal means has highlighted the need to better understand the limits of laws of gender-based violence. countering men’s rights groups who accuse feminists of infiltrating states and weaponizing marriage and sex, here i address accusations of women’s heavy-handed misuse of laws by examining their fragile temporalities and their failure to address materialities and consent. i connect my ethnographic work on negotiation of divorce and family violence in india to recent issues of sexual harassment, emphasizing the significance of context and culture in the deployment of law.

2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: saturday, november 10inclusion/revolution: feminist futures and 
military inclusion
 ■jeremiah blaise favara, emory university
in 2013, secretary of defense leon e. 
panetta lifted the ban prohibiting women from serving in combat positions in the u.s. armed forces. heralded as marking the full inclusion of women into a military from which women were long excluded, the announcement was quickly followed by recruiting materials touting the new opportunities for women. focusing on representations of inclusion in military recruiting materials and practices from 2013 to the present, this paper explores the convergence of military inclusion, gender and sexual norms, racial capitalism, and state violence to question what military inclusion means for visions of a feminist future.  
the affective technologies of gender and 
species in us militarism, chloe diamond-lenow
 ■chloe diamond-lenow, university of 
minnesota duluth
contemporary representations of 
us female soldiers must reconcile postfeminist orientalist figurations of the liberated and liberating female soldier with long-standing heteronormative nationalist figurations that position women as caretakers and nurturers of the nation. the 2017 film megan leavey, about a female marine and her time with a military working dog, reveals such a negotiation. through an analysis of this film, this paper argues that representations of female soldier-dog relationships function as affective technologies that feminize the female soldier and present her as natural maternal nurturer, while deflecting attention from the racial capitalism and dehumanizing violence that undergirds us militarism.
gender violence as a problem of alterity
 ■miranda pilipchuk, villanova university
this paper contrasts american discourses surrounding gender violence outside and inside of the us. american discourses utilize racial stereotypes to turn gender violence into a problem of the other, portraying gender violence outside the us as a cultural problem implicating people of color, while portraying gender violence within the us as a problem of individuals acting against the values of their culture—a “free” nation. by framing gender violence as a problem of the other, american discourses serve to absolve (white) america as a whole from gender violence, and support the justification of american military aggression in the global south.

on a small, limited-resource wgst department accepting the challenge to “live intersectionality beyond an intellectual commitment” as we respond to the current backlash moment by centering our financial and energetic resources on marginalized populations in our community. specifically, we have initiated a muslim women’s resource center, collaborated on research and a symposium on women of color in pwis, and hosted the campus lgbtqa+ advisory board, especially activism on behalf of the transgender community. these activities have generated interest among students, energized our faculty, and created opportunity to re-engage partnerships around campus.

392. imagining sexual justice against 
the age of consent
11:00am - 12:15pm
room 221
this roundtable explores age of consent 
as a gendering tactic of colonial and racial biopolitics. age of consent laws mobilize culturally specific logics of age-differentiation to organize proper relations between intimacy and carnality. as a central tactic of european and white settler empires, age of consent has too often delimited both dominant and oppositional imaginaries of sexual justice.
this roundtable explores key concepts 
produced by age of consent and proposes alternative imaginaries of sexual justice: kadji amin through a discussion of “pederasty”; joseph fischel through “consent”; gillian harkins through “pedophilia”; and eng-beng lim through the “colonial man-boy dyad.

women’s prisons are sites of maximum 
repression and isolation from family and community. control is maintained through violent force and the constant promotion of division and competition along lines of race, gender and sexual orientation. this workshop will examine the sustained struggle in california’s women’s prisons to forge collective resistance to these destructive strategies through the practice of “fierce care” on both sides of the prison walls. we will compare this history with practices of militant collective care and resistance that have occurred in women’s prisons in palestine to develop possibilities for shared learning and solidarity between struggles.

aging and ageism caucus
in this sponsored session of the age 
and ageism caucus, the panelists will examine and deconstruct the intersection between trump’s america and the false narrative of “successful aging” -- a popular construct in the field of gerontology, despite its classist, sexist, and ableist traits. the panelists contend that the economic and social condition of older women in the trump era proves that “successful aging” is a neoliberal myth—one that many cannot (and should not) participate in. instead, aging women must revolt to create their own utopian futures--ones that challenge the boundaries of location, economy, community, and academia.

model in mainstream gerontology
 ■peg cruikshank, independent scholar
following the publication of successful 
aging (1997) by rowe and kahn, feminist gerontologists noted the many flaws in this model, but it lives on in mainstream gerontology. the first comprehensive commentary successful aging as a contemporary obsession: global perspectives, edited by anthropologist sarah lamb, was published in 2017 . this paper will highlight previous critiques of successful aging as a paradigm for aging and draw connections to lamb’s interdisciplinary collection with a specific focus on the ways in which global perspectives indicate the limitations of aging models based only on white, middle-class male american values, urging resistance to oppressive mainstream parameters.
from ‘single girl’ to silver-haired witch: 
aging and feminist resistance in comedy central’s broad city
 ■katherine lehman, albright college
broad city’s subversive “single girls” live 
in the moment. in recent seasons, they also contemplate aging and feminist futures under trump. in new york, aging signifies power: abbi’s first gray hair grants her access to a witches’ coven of older, visionary activists. in contrast, florida retirees are portrayed as uniformly regressive, gun-toting racists. this paper analyzes how broad city celebrates intergenerational feminist resistance while also reinforcing elitist, consumer-friendly notions of “successful aging” (sandberg and marshall 2017; katz and marshall, 2003). i will also discuss how broad city’s women enact queer temporalities as they resist heterosexual norms (halberstam 2005; radner 1999).

female masculinity: some questions  
and concerns
 ■judith kegan gardiner, university of  
illinois at chicago
ever since the publication of jack halberstam’s female masculinity in 1998, the concept of “female masculinity” has enjoyed widespread acceptance.  queer theory and transgender studies have expanded, consolidated, and sometimes questioned the category while simultaneously welcoming more variable and fluid gender expressions.  however, i suggest that the concept is inherently incoherent and that it has other significant limitations, especially that it supports the abjection of femininity and props up, rather than undermines, the naturalized association of masculinity with power and the hierarchical binary of masculine over feminine gender.
escape routes: female masculinity and 
conceptual revivals of the underground railroad and the false promise of a multicultural utopia
 ■shawn newman, queen’s university
this paper examines the (re)construction 
of canada as a multicultural utopia. since trump, canada has seen a dramatic spike in the number of us asylum seekers (mehler paperny and lampert 2017). i offer a “queer return” (walcott 2016) to the underground railroad to unravel the ways that “escaping” to canada is a narrative we have seen before. specifically, i look to black female masculinities, and the 2016 black lives matter sit-in at toronto’s pride parade, to reveal that canadian multiculturalism cannot “anticipate black” (mckittrick 2014). such a reveal troubles canada’s reputation as a safe haven for people escaping to “freedom.”tending the bulldagger archive:

 ■sasha t goldberg, indiana university,

positioning america as a “post-trans 
nation” in which cisgender and transgender are employed as opposite identity categories, “tending the bulldagger archive” inquires after the butch female body. neither “a person whose gender matches their sex,” nor “a person whose gender is opposite their sex,” this study centers a cultural archive--and sustained futurities--in which female masculinity embodies lesbian specificity, rather than trans identification. with masculine women serving as an ongoing litmus test for the social, cultural, and political costs of epistemological reorganization, interviews catalog identificatory practices, negotiations, and iterations of lesbian masculinities in a post-trans temporality.
“two jewesses tryin’ to make a buck”: jewish 
female masculinity and feminist utopias in ‘broad city.’
 ■jonathan branfman, the ohio state university
comedy central’s ‘broad city’ reinvents 
racialized tropes of the masculine-yet-seductive ‘beautiful jewess’ to envision a feminist utopia of gender fluidity, unapologetic female bodies, and female sexual agency and pleasure. up to the early 20th century, the ‘beautiful jewess’ was a trope in european and euro-american culture, signifying ambiguity between “repulsive” female masculinity and alluring-yet-dirty hyperfemininity. in this paper, i connect kathryn rowe’s work on the trope of the “unruly woman” in comedy with ann pellegrini’s work on the beautiful jewess to analyze how ‘broad city’ uses racially specific tropes of the jewess to builds its utopian vision for  
all women.

who has already sketched and thus shaped the effable terrains of desire, circumscribed the possibilities of fungibility, and graphed relevance by size. the cartographer is by vocation, topical. but the black and lesbian poet directs us to the depths of pleasure by water, where “desire can rise,” “refuses retreat,” to quote nikky finney. in this paper and reading, i will discuss this very different paths of desire poets/oceanographers who begin with the possibility of pleasure “9cm deep/in  the pelvis.”
finding ceremony: black feminist poetics  
as time travel

this presentation, based on m archive: 
after the end of the world, explores what it means to approach black feminism as both a poetics of the moment and an apocalyptic archive, asking for and navigating the end of the world. how can contemporary black feminist poetics excavate the histories of defunct black feminist organizations, black feminist projects that were imagined but never realized, the small and large ways our worlds have ended over and over again at the hands of systemic oppression and our own fatigue.

inhuman reproduction: sexual violence  
and the biopolitics of slavery
 ■lauren heintz, california state university, 
los angeles
this paper examines kara walker’s 
artwork, 8 possible beginnings or: the creation of african-america. walker depicts an enslaved man who is impregnated with a cotton seed by a white man, and subsequently gives birth to a cotton plant. drawing on hortense spillers and riley snorton, i argue that the transgender pregnancy and reproduction of the cotton plant forces us to question the biopolitical limits of the gendered and racial intersections of sexual violence in slavery. i show that walker’s artistic interrogation of sexual violence ultimately questions if queer, trans, and interracial sexualities are ever able to achieve liberationist futures.
grossed out: reading disgust from  
dworkin to #metoo
 ■mairead sullivan, loyola marymount universitythis paper reads proclamations of 
disgust in response to sexual harassment allegations, specifically those leveled against harvey weinstein, in order to elucidate a theory of ordinary sexual violence. drawing on the work on sara ahmed and silvan tomkins, i argue that the mechanism of disgust recognizes the everydayness of sexual violence even while naming it as aberrant. i explore how contemporary art and activism, including the artist collective pussypowerhouse and #metoo movements, are returning to the vitriol that rendered dworkin disgusting.  
how might a politics of disgust unseat the over-reliance on consent and criminal abnormality in approaches to  
sexual violence?
sexual necropolitics and resistance during 
argentina’s “dirty war”
 ■viviana beatriz macmanus,  
occidental college
this paper examines sexual 
necropolitics in the argentinean film, garage olimpo. the film is a fictional account of the detention of activist maria during the argentinean dictatorship. the portrayal of maria’s captive body on screen evinces the centrality of sexuality in necropolitics as the masculinist, military state reinforced absolute power over her death through sexual means. drawing on hortense spillers’ term “pornotrope” and achille mbembe’s concept of necropolitics, this paper asks the following: is it possible for narrative cinema to represent sexual violence committed by the masculinist state without making a fetishistic spectacle of captive bodies?

de-linking reproductive healthcare from work: 
envisioning a different economic future for women in the united states
 ■melissa mahoney, university of north carolina

 ■kate bahn, washington center for  
equitable growth
what would it mean to imagine a future 
economy premised on bodily autonomy of all individuals, that mandates reproductive health care rights for all women in the united states? building on economic research in the u.s., this paper explores how women’s access to reproductive healthcare is necessary for accessing economic opportunity. using the work of economist amartya sen and philosopher martha nussbaum,  
it envisions a different future that de-links reproductive health care from labor market opportunity; moving toward a post-capitalist future for the united states by taking a step toward disconnecting women’s reproductive rights from employment.
empowered bleeders and cranky menstruators: 
menstrual positivity and the ‘liberated’ era of new menstrual product advertisements
 ■ela przybylo, simon  
fraser university
 ■breanne fahs, arizona state university
we examine a series of new menstrual 
product ads, including “reality check” by kotex (2013), “first moon party” (kotex, 2014), “#likeagirl” by always (2014), and “blood” by bodyform uk (2016). we argue that these ads co-opt feminist discourses of body positivity and menstrual positivity toward pushing consumer capitalist goals of selling menstrual gear with an “empowered” message. aligned with recent queer work on the political import of negativity and feminist disability studies perspectives on pain, we argue for the importance of “menstrual crankiness” in pushing at sexist and transphobic discourses around embodiment and taking stock of material pains and pleasures.
imagining justice for working women through 
a maternal gift economy: a comparative case study of migrant nepali domestic workers and migrant chinese factory workers
 ■crystal whetstone, university of cincinnati
 ■sayam moktan, university of cincinnati
we make a theoretical argument for 
workers’ rights based on the maternal gift economy. the current international architecture, which benefits consumers of goods and services in industrialized, capitalist countries, harms women domestic and factory workers of low income countries. using a comparative case study, we imagine justice for women workers through a system rooted in the maternal gift economy, which describes economies defined not by markets but rather the needs of societies, met through gift giving rather than financial transactions. however, we take a critical, nonessentialist eye to this literature, which has romanticized pre-market societies to the point of caricature.

 ■carolina arango-vargas, drew university
critiques of us imperial history are 
central to transnational feminism yet some histories remain hidden. in particular, this paper reflects on the field’s limited engagement with the colombian armed conflict - embedded in global economies of war- and with the women who have invested their labor imagining a peaceful and just society. their organizing practices speak of the possibilities of enabling agency and imagining new worlds in violent conditions, constituting global sites of feminist political and epistemic resistance. this talk explores the political work needed to center south epistemologies and how pedagogies of empathy and epistemic justice foster transnational academic solidarity.”

“one cannot only depend on the academy and publishing as critical knowledge.” similarly, in this article,  
 the author challenges feminists interested in including through their curriculum, scholarship from the global south as part of their critical pedagogy, while continuing to discount the scholarship  
of those who hail from the english-speaking caribbean. using empirical data, the author asks, whose scholarship counts as anti-imperial? and, why are the knowledges of some black  
women valued more than others

drawing on feminist pedagogy, 
science and technology studies, and radical making, this paper explores the potentials of engineering and crafting as critical inquiry by presenting several models of radical technoscientific making: a humanities classroom with an incorporated lab, an event built around the cross-pollination of deconstruction and dismantlement, and the construction of an explicitly inclusive “maker” space. together, these models explore the possibility of bringing engineering into interdisciplinary humanities classrooms, critique the dominant narrative of educational technology as “digitizing content for online distribution,” and challenge the capitalist and neoliberal co-optation of maker, fixer, and  diy narratives.
radical critical workshopping as method 
for establishing feminist pedagogies for critiquing and building technologies
 ■ellen foster, institute for advanced studies

within maker cultures, workshops are 
a way to share knowledge and often build a sense of community. they also become a way in which to solidify ‘best’ practices and the expected ways in which to build diy technologies. but what kind of knowledge might be produced when leading workshops that problematize or unpack the types of skills shared, how they are shared, who is involved, and what is considered ‘best’ practice and why? this paper presents research that reconstructively examines identity-formation and the communities of practice that are fostered (and those that are marginalized) by diy tech-based cultures.

a comparative analysis of three popular 
periodicals- essence, playboy, and cosmopolitan- during the early 1970s and traces the competing discourses that presented black women as undesirable and lacking beauty to discourses that explicitly framed black women as sexy, classy, and suitably urban. the differing missions for these publications allows for a rich analysis as all three engage with these changing discourses of race, gender, and sexuality in unique ways. this research contributes to both wgs and the emerging field of periodical studies by examining black women’s sexual representations in magazines during this historically significant

and anthropology scholars, this poster posits the question: how do students of color at predominantly white institutions develop a spatial imaginary that allows them to build and sustain the physical environments they occupy on campus? taking into consideration their built environment, rooted in a white spatial imaginary, how then do they also create and sustain a community of color spatial imaginary that supports their sense of being and belonging in the spaces they occupy and as members of their  campus community?

“just imagine” a world without hiv/aids: 
black feminist interventions in health justice
 ■karleen victoria schlichtmann, university  
of florida
what’s a world without hiv/aids? 
reducing the rates of hiv/aids starts with better health care policy, prevention, intervention, and treatment programs. demanding that all hiv/aids testing and treatment be current with the latest findings in medical research, we must question the statistics. why are women of color still affected by hiv/aids more than their white female counterparts? reducing hiv/aids rates requires research and activism. this poster focuses on how women of color are affected by hiv/aids along with current intervention plans. i imagine how better health care policy, treatment, and intervention programs can change how women  
of color experience health justice.
removing the stigma against muslims through 
education and awareness
 ■astha patel, university of kentucky
over the past two decades, because 
of a perceived threat of terrorism, there has been a rise of islamophobia and violence against muslims. the prejudice directed toward muslims has also been broadly generalized to a wide array of people of color, including people from the middle east and asia. much of the islamophobia in the us is due to a lack of knowledge about religions, cultures, and geography. this study, derived from the theories and methods of social psychology, examined whether educating americans about islam, cultures, and geography can lower bias against muslims.
sex/gender totalitarianism
 ■katherine von wald, simmons college
this poster will offer a reimagining of the sex/gender system as a totalitarian political machine. using the logic of totalitarian ideological constructs this project intends to discuss the ways that bodies are organized, utilized, and produced through categories of sex, gender, desire, and race. further, i argue that we must then rethink possibilities of public political dissidence. what role does dissident serve? who are these dissidents? how can dissidence be fostered? this project will argue that  
the very notions of possibility,  
of identity, and of personhood  
must be directly challenged.

possibilities of electoral politics
 ■angela high-pippert, university of st. thomas
this paper analyzes the long-term 
political impact of u. s. representative shirley chisholm, who herself noted the “revolutionary” possibilities of electoral politics. chisholm’s political legacy includes being the first african-american woman elected to congress, and the first african-american woman to run for the presidency as a major party candidate. through this contextual analysis of her history, policy priorities, legislative achievements, and campaign speeches, chisholm’s legacy and significance as a “feminist troublemaker” is explored.

at a time when cultural, medical, and 
legislative attention is acutely focused on the transgender community, a dearth of research on this marginalized group persists, especially with regards to transgender children. aiming to empower society to best support the needs of this demographic, the presenters examined the continuity of preferences in gender expression from childhood to adulthood. this poster presents research on the constancy of gender identity; in other words, does gender expression measurably  
change, or remain static, from  
childhood to adulthood? how can future research become more inclusive of the transgender and  
gender-variant community?

“do
minant masculine populism and 
feminization of politics in podemos”
 ■paloma caravantes, rutgers university
using the case of the spanish politial 
party podemos, this paper examines the possibilities and challenges that populist forces pose to feminist politics. embracing populism in response to the legitimation crisis of the political class, podemos commits to a gender-informed interpretation of democratic renewal based on the “feminization of politics.” nonetheless, podemos reproduces the “masculinized” logic that it openly problematizes. this is the result of the party’s tacit acceptance of dominant masculine traits—competition, confrontation and hierarchy—as unavoidable features of political organization, communication, and leadership, expressed through the populist emphasis on winning power in the name of the ‘people.’
“cruising nostalgia: the here and now of 
white masculinity”
 ■cord-heinrich plinke, university of  
southern california
this paper takes muñoz’ assertion from 
cruising utopia that queerness is a “not yet here” and thinks it in conjunction with nostalgia as a utopian project. doing so, i interrogate the upsurge in 1980s and ‘90s nostalgia in the age of “make america great again” and the public feeling inherent in this proclamation, with a focus on whiteness and cis-masculinity in contemporary cultural objects. can we understand the nostalgic attachment to an assumedly great american past as a reaction to the “not yet here” of queerness, or do these nostalgic visions retroactively write queerness out  of the past?
#carefreeblackboy and the will to  
racial innocence
 ■antonia randolph, winston-salem  
state universitythis paper examines the utopian potential 
embodied in the #carefreeblackboy identity. the #carefreeblackboy identity allows black men to assert a racial innocence denied to them as children.[1] racial innocence is the idea that western culture imbued white children with inherent innocence to buttress claims about black’s inherent depravity and monstrousness.[2] i argue that the #carefreeblackboy identity is an embodiment of the black queer feminist lens promoted by blm and other current social movements. through analyzing representations, i show how adopting the child-like identity of “boy” allows black men to refuse constraints placed on them.

claiming the city: care and struggles  
over detroit
 ■jessi quizar, northern arizona university
this paper examines detroit activists’ 
effort to assert claims to land and housing in the city based on a logic of care in resistance to a logic of racial capitalism. drawing on “a black sense of space” and black feminist traditions, detroiters have responded to waves of displacement in the city with a competing logic and organizing. this logic asserts that those who have deep caring relationships with the city—in the affective sense and in the sense of stewardship—should be able to stay and shape its future.
partitioned publics and carceral care
 ■ujju aggarwal, the new school
i examine the divergent ways that mothers mobilize the notion of care to claim the rights of their children in a racially and economically diverse, yet intensely segregated and unequal school district. i trace how the production of gendered political subjectivities of raced and classed motherhood align with the valorization of care and kinship structured through the exclusion that whiteness as property requires and, contaminantly, the criminalization of practices of care and kinship rooted in mutuality and collectivity. in the latter,  
i argue, we find an immanent architecture of rights and belonging  
that enlivens the black radical tradition.
the gumby book studio & scrapbooks  
of feeling
 ■amrit trewn, new york university
the forthcoming paper attends to 
scrapbooks assembled by alexander gumby, a prominent early-twentieth century black bibliophile who operated a vibrant book studio in harlem. how did this midcentury black artist negotiate ongoing regimes of anti-black surveillance and policing through his space-making and scrapbooking practices? in gumby’s work, i contend that state-sanctioned surveillance is contested not only through strategies that “watch the watcher,” but also emergent practices of care. throughout, i build a framework to understand gumby’s scrapbooking as a black feminist geography— one that gestures towards strategies for keeping vigil watch over the black ill and dead.

 ■saraellen strongman, university of michigan
this paper examines how groups of and 
individual black feminists’ collected and shared literature by and about black women during the 1970s and 80s. this paper argues that attending to how and what black feminist reading communities collected, copied, and circulated reveals the conscious creation of a black feminist canon during this time. furthermore, how black feminists sought to recover black women writers from the past and construct a genealogy of black feminist thought reveals how they were attempting to imagine their own black queer feminist utopia by turning to the past for guidance.
the perpetual horizon of lesbian feminist 
information: digitizing movement histories in contemporary online networks
 ■cait mckinney, california state  
university, northridge
digital platforms such as instagram 
enliven lesbian-feminist activist ephemera within contemporary queer networks as users labor gathering, classifying, and distributing information about the past. queer online networks use tagging, interface design, and citational practices to hold users accountable to the specificities of the histories they engage, and to re-center anti-racism and trans-inclusion as urgent issues present within movement histories. like the earlier movements they reference, digital information activists practice lesbian-feminist “archiving” as an ongoing and uncompletable interpretive and medial process whose horizon is precisely that there will always be more lesbian paper to sort, digitize, and share.
seamoon house’s radical feminist model of 
psychological disability, and the future of feminist, queer, and disability studies
 ■rachel corbman, stony brook universityin 1981, seamoon house published 
what might be her only article in print: “a radical feminist model of psychological disability.” an atlanta based lesbian feminist, house was simultaneously in dialogue with a densely interconnected network of lesbian feminist disability activists and the csx (consumer/survivor/ex-patient) movement, though she was notably critical of the former’s focus on physical impairments, and the latter’s discomfort with disability as a category. based on archival research at the lesbian herstory archives and duke, this paper considers house’s little known writings in order to imagine new possibilities for feminist, queer, and disability studies.

from #blacklivesmatter, to the 
#women’s march, to high school student-led lie-ins, these high-visibility marches and protests look like familiar activism. grounded in the intersection of class, wgs, and agency, this paper presents findings of two case studies at community colleges and asserts an alter-narrative of activism that challenges the hegemonic depiction of mass protests in mainstream media. this explores the institutional dislocation of community college activism, and then re-centers the individual stories of activist agency and social justice harnessed through/by wgs students and faculty.
imagining global justice at a local 
community college: student voices and subjectivities in feminist theory
 ■sheryl fairchild, sacramento city college
imagining global justice within 
women’s studies has compelled us to adopt transnational pedagogies to prepare students for a globalized world. as feminist teachers we stand on precarious ground as we critically question, in relationship with our students, our positionality and representational violences embedded in globally-oriented pedagogies and theories. my research is grounded in the intersection of transnational feminist teaching and the community college, where students bring their own complex cross-border histories and subjectivities into the classroom to actively challenge epistemological gaps and enrich feminist theories.

mothers betwixt and between the boundaries of higher education
 ■anne elizabeth hofmann, frederick

this paper explores the spatial and 
structural implications of considering community colleges as borderlands that create both passages and barriers for students seeking geographically and financially accessible education. in particular, mothers seeking degrees disproportionately attend community colleges over four-year institutions because they are tied to the location of their families; however, collegiate structures rarely facilitate a path forward for this population (rose &hill 2013). from the problematic intersections of gender roles, class privilege, and racialized identities, i assert that community colleges are sites of struggle betwixt and within the systems of public education and the neoliberal project to control domestic labor

with theme 6: political, cultural, and 
artistic movements that “demand the impossible” as an inspiration, my paper argues that the intellectual activism of the national alliance of black feminists (1974-1983) promoted a new vision of black womanhood and of feminist liberation for black women and men. articles, organizational documents, courses offered at the alternative school are part of black women’s intellectual history and are dispatches from a struggle for black women’s social, economic, and legal rights. speaking the language of rights and of humanism and based on personal experience, these writings demand the impossible: full equality for black women.

arnold (1926-1982), bertha harris (1936-2005), and rita mae brown (1944-) as a supportive social network that enabled their writing, politics, and ideas to reach a broader audience within women’s and lgbtq political organizing in and around new york city from the mid-1960s through the late ‘70s. by focusing on their creation of and publishing with daughters, incorporated—the first lesbian-feminist press in the u.s.—i argue that their understandings of race, class, gender, and sexuality as a white southern queer diaspora challenged those of mainstream political organizations, thus causing tension within women’s and lgbtq movements.

this paper examines manifestations

the successful crowd-funded 
documentary unrest, which aims to increase public awareness of the feminized condition me/cfs, raises questions about how self-branding culture shapes what forms health activism can take. the film and its director navigate the disjuncture between neoliberal cultures of self-branding (which requires 24/7 individual, productive labor) and health activist/disability cultures (which value interdependence, distributed labor, and nonproductive time). the film’s aesthetics, its paratexts, and its intersectionality instantiate what i call, drawing on diedrich’s “indirect action,” “crip action.” “crip action” might help us theorize the practice of health activism for marginalized groups living within regimes of debilitation.

in november of 1902, pauline hopkins 
began serializing “of one blood; or the hidden self” in the colored american magazine, of which she was the editor. in this text, where she critiques the then-current ideologies of race, space, and time, while imagining and centering the possibilities of a technologically advanced african nation, hopkins was at the forefront of the speculative fiction genre known as afrofuturism. her radical imagination illustrates how we must not only reckon with, but recognize the multiple feminist pasts that sought to create spaces of autonomy and possibility for those at the margins.
re-thinking feminist spirituality through

this paper offers a critical thematic 
reading of feminist periodicals including womanspirit (1974-1984), thesmophoria (1979-1981), and sister (1973-1976), among other titles, to ask questions about the cultural and political within feminist spirituality communities. new age elements in feminist culture have been critiqued by scholars for a perceived gender essentialism, apolitical individualism, and racist practices of cultural appropriation. in this paper, i look to periodicals as evidence of the rituals, mythologies, earth-based reverence, and other cultural sites which served as magical tools for creating new forms of feminist utopic imaginings within the second wave and beyond.
from survival sourcebook to magazine:

 ■meredith benjamin, barnard college
recent scholarship has urged us to look 
at feminist magazines and periodicals as another way to complicate simplistic or homogeneous narratives of feminism in the 1970s and 1980s (see beins, halberstam). in this paper, i take up that call by looking closely at chrysalis: a magazine of women’s culture (1977-1980), as well as letters relating to the magazine in the archives of various feminists. i ask how such magazines complicate our narratives of feminism in this era, and how we might learn from their endeavors to shape new communities and practices.

the ways in which they are responding to challenges (budget cuts, staffing issues, etc.) in higher education in creative ways. some questions the panelists will address are: how can gender studies departments work productively within institutions when those institutions themselves perpetuate sexism and racism? does there need to be a new/another feminist consciousness raising within the academy? what is the role of engaged teaching and scholarship in these efforts? at a time when regular faculty are increasingly being replaced by adjuncts and staff, how can these groups work together more productively?

room 221
in 1984 audre lorde famously declared 
that “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” but what if the only tools available are the master’s? can a revolution ever happen from within? from working within the administration and the classroom to university and departmental programming aimed at directly challenging the neoliberal university, this roundtable will explore insurgent strategies from within the ivory tower walls to effect change both within and outside of those walls.

(de)humanizing the muslim: gender, race, 
and religion in transnational cinema
 ■gohar siddiqui, clark university
this paper will look at the intersection 
of cinema and muslim representation to examine the varying ways in which global islamophobia has dehumanized muslim bodies, particularly in film. i will examine three films that tackle anti-muslim racism within gendered, sexualized, and racial contexts—road to guantanamo (uk); osama (afghanistan); and bajrangi bhaijaan (india). these films engender empathy with muslim protagonists by suturing audience identification via narrative and cinematography. the paper will then discuss the ways in which these specific national contexts advance the project of islamophobia and examine through these films interruptions of the global anti-racist imaginings regarding muslim bodies.
digital nationalism: mourning and 
melancholia in modi’s india
 ■nashra mahmood, university of california, 
los angeles
“what makes for a grievable life?” 
(butler 2004). pondering upon this question, this paper examines the entangled relationship between the ‘inability to mourn’ and the ‘unmournable body’ in digitized nationalism of contemporary india. tracing the launch of digital india campaign in 2015, i posit that the rapid circulation of the video clips depicting the murders of pehlu khan and afrazul on whatsapp, construct distinct nationalist subjects through their practice of mourning. with hindu nationalist sentiments on the rise, i argue that the hindu subject is robbed of his ability to mourn, whereas, the muslim subject becomes the ‘unmournable body’.
embodiment of race and gender in american 
apparel ads
 ■nadia roche, university of california,  
santa cruz
by analyzing visual culture in the form 
of an american apparel ad “made in bangladesh” this paper addresses discourses of nationalism and coloniality, and utilizes an intersectional analysis using feminist and post colonial theories of gender and critical race theory, specifically in regards to the ways in which notions of modernity and nation, become mixed-in with notions of embodiment, which bodies are considered human or nonhuman,  ‘us’ or ‘other.’
the making of human and their others in/
through human rights advocacy
 ■shenila khoja-moolji, bowdoin college
this article examines the discursive 
articulation of two global human rights icons, mukhtar mai and malala yousafzai from pakistan, to illustrate how the language of rights constitutes particular bodies as human and others as sub/in-human. gendered and racialized notions of empowerment and vulnerability, as well as the centrality of corporeal suffering delinked from geopolitics and economics, play a constitutive role in marking muslim men as sub-human. such knowledge-making practices are problematic as they (re)install liberal norms and position the white, anglophone male as representing full humanity.

this paper uses queer comics theory to 
explore how graphic novels, memoirs, and comics by and about sex workers represent and resist criminalization and participate in queer world-making. examining the works of jacqueline frances, molly crabapple, and michelle tea, i aim to explore how these authors and illustrators use the comic form to both negotiate present-day whorephobic realities of state violence, incarceration, and stigmatization and also participate in a radical imagination of a world with different and more liberatory economic, labor, and sexual relations.

feminism, gender and race in women’s 
comedy: the political potentialities of pleasure
 ■robyn stacia swink, university of missouri
this paper examines the expanding 
genre of “women’s comedy” in popular culture, focusing on several popular texts as well as examining audiences’ responses to these texts. further, the paper explores the ways that some women’s comedy engages with feminist discourses, how audiences make sense of these representations, and finally how the race and gender of the women doing the comedy and the race and gender of audience members are related to the audiences’ engagement with the comedy. central to the investigation is the role of pleasure: what are the political potentialities of the pleasures offered by women’s comedy?
“imagining a resolution for the korean 
“comfort women” issue: cho jung-rae’s spirits’ homecoming (2016)”
 ■margaret diane stetz, university of delaware
the seemingly intractable problem of 
how to resolve the “comfort women” issue —even of how to name it, as the japanese government resists the phrase “sexual slavery” used by survivors and activist supporters—continues to divide south korea and japan. meanwhile, the japanese military’s wwii victimization of women and underage girls has been a source of shame for many koreans. in spirits’ homecoming (2016), south korean writer/director cho jung-rae turns from the political realm to find a solution in the sphere of imagination. cho’s film dramatizes intergenerational empathy and identification in imagining a welcome home for the dead  victims’ souls.

public dialoguing: an insurgent alternative to 
call-out culture
 ■elizabeth currans, eastern michigan university
the internet has allowed activists to 
dialogue with and to learn from each other across geographical distances. internet engagements have also permitted critique, both constructive and destructive, to occur quickly and, sometimes, violently. in this paper we propose using the model of difficult dialogues in the form of “public dialoguing” as an insurgent practice in social justice movements and to lessen the emotionally abusive and violent forms of call out culture. public dialoguing allows for open conversations, in contrast to the private emphasis of “calling in”, and can serve as a model for building and sharing knowledge within justice movements.
understanding call-out culture and moving 
towards a post-oppositional politic
 ■kali furman, oregon state university
learning to recognize our actions and 
modes of thinking that are grounded in the oppression of marginalized people, bias, and stereotyping is an important component of feminist and social justice work, but is call out culture the best method to achieve this end? this paper examines the evolution of call-out culture in the context of oppositional politics of the left and following keating (2013), argue that a post-oppositional politics offers a useful framework for engaging in sustained, meaningful examination of complex differences and commonalities.
calling-out call-outs: the need for  
bystander intervention
 ■jo trigilio, simmons college
call-outs that publically persecute and 
humiliate well-intentioned allies result in several forms of political and ethical harms that, paradoxically, constitute injustice. politically, call-out culture silences the voices of those whose experiences of oppression are discordant with the hegemonic narrative of an oppressed identity group. ethically, “punishment” meted out by a call-out is disproportionate to the “crime”. an ethic of care that treats human beings as whole persons instead of disposable others underlies feminist principles of social justice. calling-in is ethical alternative, but we also need to begin practicing bystander interventions to halt destructive call-outs in their earliest stages.221

discovering “underneath histories”: toni 
morrison’s paradise & chicago communities as a springboard to critical ownership
 ■rosie banks, harold washington college
in a 2002 interview, morrison describes 
her project in the beloved – jazz – paradise trilogy: “i want to scour the official history for the alternate history that exists, sometimes parallel to it, more often underneath it” (joyner, 2003). teaching research with an exploration of what morrison calls “underneath histories” and what others call insider knowledge engages students and enables them to gain a more critical research lens. this paper describes that movement from literary and community analysis to student ownership of their own research.

in which constructing your syllabi’s classroom policies can provide a space for radical change and transcend the boilerplate rhetoric we often include. how can we allow room for each student? how can we encourage patience and collegiality while also fostering debate? i will share my strategies as an educator, and we’ll create new ones for each other.
nice women making history: an early 
childhood education academic program pushes back and wins through the power  
of relationship and caring communities
 ■carrie nepstad, harold washington college
this is the story of an academic program, 
in a traditionally female dominated discipline, that pushed back against a top-down decision to close programs. based on poorly formed ideas of the “value” of the associate degree in early childhood education and the role graduates serve in caring for young children and families, the closings would cut-off access for underserved communities of chicago. women’s resistance/activism resulted in a reimagining of new relationships  
within the community college and  
within communities.

zano 
& delgado-bernal, 2001) and healing (ginwright, 2010; 2015); and the role healing plays in imaginative educative frameworks. integrating healing into post-secondary work is an insurgent practice as it focuses on the needs of students, takes a systemic approach to well-being that removes blame from individuals, and seeks to use the institute as a setting for well-being.

in this workshop, participants discuss 
storytelling as a vehicle to foster social justice dialogues about the wellbeing of families, past, present, and future. we focus on re-imagining family histories and structures that have been erased and distorted by ideology, nostalgia, policy, and white patriarchal supremacy. in re-imagining family stories we address trauma, disruptions, and separations that many families experience, but are rarely made public. ideological constructions of “legitimate” history and normative family structures have erased gendered racialized violence. we utilize family stories to interrogate “master” narratives about citizenship, immigration, and belonging, and to envision a more just and inclusive future.

corporeal utopia and the pakistani action 
heroine: women’s cinema in a border-crossing film industry
 ■esha niyogi de, university of california, los 
angeles
in 1980s islamizing pakistan, star-
director shamim ara made dissident action heroine films such as miss hong kong (1979) and miss colombo (1984). this was a time of brutal policing of female bodies in the name of islamic patriarchal honor, and violence on religious minorities. contrarily, shamim ara’s fighter heroines magically avoid rather than suffer male contact, while enabling corporeal bonds across religious and geographic borders. the paper highlights the gendered specificities of the material cultures fostering utopian figurations of corporeal desire and dissidence in entertainment cinema. these figurations illuminate a border-crossing entertainment culture stemming from the woman director’s familial networks.
new indian cinema and the politics  
of gendered utopia
 ■alka kurian, university of washington bothell
this paper explores representations 
in hatke (alternative indian) cinema of a radical shift in gender politics encapsulating the cultural revolution that resulted from the country’s 1990s neo-liberal turn. it investigates how films such as parched (2015), anarkali of aarah (2017), and lipstick under my burkha (2017) subvert traditional delineation of femininity. it examines how the surfacing of women’s sexual desire and their location outside marriage or motherhood underlines the coming into being of their sexual and autonomous agency and triggers solidarity among women who do not need rescue or validation from masculinity, ushering in, therefore, a new gendered utopia.three images of resistance
 ■s. charusheela, university of  
washington bothell
how do we represent rural and 
adivasi women’s resistance to policies of economic development and globalization? this talk examines three documentary representations of rural and adivasi women’s resistance to capitalist development – something like a war, creating a case study: the gyarsi bai story, and red ant dream. while all three documentaries represent these women as strong and feminist, they reveal very different understandings of what women’s empowerment and resistance mean. contrasting these representations, the paper unpacks the role played by our own understandings of liberation in interpreting the actions of these women.

from it gets better to we deserve better: 
queer storytelling and state violence
 ■jo hsu, university of arkansas
in a multimodal campaign titled  
“we deserve better,” queer and trans youth-led organization breakout! mobilized stories from their community to protest police violence and reform state policies. this paper examines how breakout!’s particular use of personal and collective storytelling collapsed normative temporality (edelman; freeman) to enable a “politics of relation” (carrillo rowe). i argue that breakout!’s wide-ranging advocacy tactics model the use of affective alliances among disparate experiences in ways that expose the interrelated oppressions of the criminal justice system, public housing policies, and public education.
perpetual (in)securities and the global 
border industrial complex
 ■alejandra i. ramirez, university of arizona
this paper looks at the (re)production of 
perpetual (in)securities within the context of the “border security” discourse of the global border industrial complex (gbic). i analyze the wende museum’s installation of the berlin wall in los angeles and one of its murals that depicts two pregnant women in a yin-yang position with the words: “good can come from bad can come from good”. 
i analyze them as transversal interlocutors 
in order to describe how they affect and are affected by sensations of globalized nation-state violence through avery gordon’s ghostly matters, tina campt’s listening to images, and gloria anzaldúa’s borderlands/la frontera borderland theory.”
abolitionist art and aesthetic practices in the 
works of gilda posada and dignidad rebelde ■gloria negrete-lopez, university of arizona
in this paper i utilize the theoretical work 
of jennifer gonzález (2008), angela davis (2005), and gloria anzaldua (2015) to think about how abolitionist art practices and aesthetics help provide images of what is yet to come. in gilda posada’s mural “abolish borders”, she uses installation, patterns, and text to engage in a call to action for an abolitionist future. similarly, “toward liberation” by artist melanie cervantes of dignidad rebelde uses imagery, color, lines, and text to produce an image that depicts abolition in action. both artists utilize their work to help audiences imagine a world without captivity.

roots of mad studies: a  
genealogical reimagining
 ■lzz johnk, oregon state university
this paper will reimagine the 
genealogical roots of mad studies through the work of indigenous/women of color feminists. i argue that mad studies and feminist disability studies have an imperative to critique their pervasive centering of whiteness as a harmful elision of the experiences of mad, neurodivergent, and disabled people of colour and of the contributions of feminist scholars of color to our understandings of materiality, embodiment, psychospiritual experience, and challenges to a colonial conceptualization of reality.
discomfort, access, and disability  
justice organizing ■ashley mog, independent scholar
in this paper, i draw from oral histories 
with queer disability justice activists in seattle to analyze comfort, coalition, intersectionality, and activist organizing through a critical feminist disability studies lens. i argue that coalition can bring us closer to the open parameters that leave room for worldmaking, while being highly uncomfortable work. comfort has a complex relationship to activist organizing, to showing up at activist events, and to choosing what to participate in. comfort is slippery, it becomes conflated with privilege and expressed through domination. imagining justice requires grappling with one’s own discomfort.

how do afro-caribbean women

characters who engage in a discourse well beyond that which can be read as a simple criticism of historical practices of allotment and land ownership. rather than dichotomize good and evil— although elements of the latter loom large—erdrich emphasizes relationships, in order to challenge perceptions of property, sexuality and colonization. four souls not only highlights andrea smith’s assertion that “colonialism is itself structured by the logic of sexual violence” but simultaneously presents a set of narratives within which decolonization can lead to sexual self-determination.environmental violence and vietnamese 
american resettlement in the gangster  we are all looking for
 ■emily cheng, montclair state
this paper addresses the convergence 
of a feminist and environmental lens in le thi diem thuy’s novel, the gangster we are all looking for. i examine how these analytic lenses offer a reimagination of the dominant teleological narratives of vietnamese refugee displacement and resettlement in the u.s. by focusing on the violence of the vietnam war and in the u.s. and connecting the past of vietnam and the present of california spatially and temporally in the eyes of the young girl narrator. i focus on how this connection takes place through two key environmental tropes: water and trees.
perception and conscience.
 ■petra m. schweitzer, shenandoah university
this paper examines tamara ralis’s short stories “dreamers of earth and aether,” in relation to radical feminism. her artistic work provides a platform for investigating the most current global problems such as earthquakes, droughts, floods, starving, being beheaded or shot or embellish images of tragic events powered by patricharcial thought. using each story as a site of inquiry, her characters call upon moral and ethical processing of singular events. these catastrophic events, i argue, are tied to issues of real concern to women, that is, feminist activism in response to unjust conditions structured around masculine-centered discourse.
the fates’ revenge: violence against women 
and the environment in david catlin’s moby dick adaptation
 ■leah marie becker, university of illinois at 
urbana champaign
this paper explores how david catlin’s 
2017 production of moby dick at chicago’s lookingglass theatre uses performative tools to equate (in the spirit of annette kolodny) the plight of the sexualized and objectified woman with that of the equally sexualized and objectified natural world. in catlin’s moby dick, women become the hunted whales: they are strung up, stripped, used, and left bare. but they also collectively become the white whale and the sea—exacting revenge for their lost sisters. this adaptation thus rewrites the violence of resource extraction and industrialization, highlighting the potential for feminine and natural power.
water archives: visionary reserves for 
decolonizing the rio carmelo in deborah miranda’s bad indians: a tribal memoir
 ■shanae aurora martinez, university of 
wisconsin-milwaukee
my literary analysis centers on a 
particular dream scene in which miranda’s tribal stories converge to reveal the river as an indigenous epistemological archive that allows miranda to map her homeland by imagining how the stories fit together on the physical landscape. by emphasizing the significance of place-based narratives this paper is committed to dismantling oppressive institutionalized discourses with geopolitical ramifications by expanding the definition of an archive according to indigenous epistemologies and using the knowledge located in water archives for decolonization.

kurdish women in turkish prisons
 ■berivan sarikaya, university of toronto
through the study of kurdish women’s 
resistance, this paper explores the role of incarcerated women in kurdish movement and offers an alternative knowledge to both the male-dominated canonical and the feminist approach to the kurdish women’s movement. kurdish resistance history has become incomplete and gendered since it silenced the kurdish women political prisoners’ experience. however, the stories and voices of these women have indispensable part of transformative power for kurdish movement. through using dialectical historical materialism, i argue that without tracing the experiences of kurdish women prisoners, it is impossible to understand the contemporary dynamics of kurdish women’s movement.
feminist resurgence after tunisia’s  
jasmine revolution
 ■heather jendoubi, university of memphis
the jasmine revolution allowed for 
a resurgence of feminism in tunisia that is re-defining gender, sexuality, and family. post-revolution, feminists with the privilege to do so, organized campaigns against domestic violence and succeeded in changing laws, now allowing women to marry non-muslim men, as well as, disallowing a rapist to avoid prison by marry the victim. this paper looks at the ways tunisian feminists construct and perform their gendered and sexual identities.
re-imagining feminism and statelessness:

“a(ce) is for abolition: on asexual 
intersections with the work of freedom”
 ■ianna hawkins owen, williams collegefollowing cathy cohen’s call to 
recognize connections between prison construction and the disproportionate incarceration of poc in relation to queer as descriptive of expendability, this paper asserts that if the asexual is a queer subject, she must contend with the ways asexuality is constructed as at odds with the social construction of the prisoner as both hypersexual and hyperaggressive and the ways in which this overlaps with the construction of blackness as such. this paper asserts that challenging all forms of hierarchy and coercion necessitates recognizing the co-constitution of asexuals and the incarcerated as artificially held apart.
“polish asexualities: catholic religiosity and 
asexual online activisms in poland”
 ■anna kurowicka, polish academy of sciences
in this paper we draw on asexuality 
studies as well as research in transnational sexual activisms and central and eastern european (cee) sexualities to explore asexual online activisms in poland. we consider how asexuality takes shape in the polish context and how activism itself is mobilized and adapted to fit the needs of an asexual sexual minority in this post state-socialist, neoliberal, and prevalently catholic nation-state. we examine asexual definitions and activisms in the polish context with an interest in how they function in conversation with polish attachments to whiteness, religious subjecthood, and heteronormative reproduction of the values of state-formation.
a case for including asexuality in the study 
of history: fighting against historical amnesia and evasion of colonial responsibility
 ■ai baba, cornell university
with the assumption that all human 
beings are sexual, discussions of sexual violence against women by men in history lead deniers to claim that it was inevitable, because sexuality is innate. for example, this is the case with those who refuse to acknowledge the “comfort women,” who were sexually enslaved by the imperial japanese military during world war ii. but was it really inevitable? this paper will propose how including asexuality in the study of history can help fight against historical amnesia and evaders of colonial responsibility, by using japan, formerly an empire, as a case study

from the ground up: voice, memory, and 
decolonial possibilities in larissa lai’s salt fish girl
 ■iris blake, university of california, riverside
in larissa lai’s speculative fiction salt 
fish girl, memories and scents of both colonial violence and decolonial possibilities come up through the ground, through the soles/souls of the feet. whereas voice is typically imagined as sonic and human, a move that i argue maintains the racialized, sexualized, and gendered distinction between the human and the non-human, salt fish girl re-imagines voice as intimately tied to memory, scent, and land. the voice of the land, figured through entwined memories and scents, overpowers racial capitalist modes of relationality and containment, remembrance and forgetting, to posit otherwise modes of being and relating.
mikhail bakhtin’s concept of hybridity in 
alice walker’s epistolary novel
 ■fatemeh saber, my private tutor
although mikhail bakhtin never mentions 
gender issues, his notion of hybridity remarkably is relevant to alice walker’s epistolary novel, the color purple (1982). this paper focuses on bakhtin’s concept of hybridity, analyzing it through walker’s novel. it will be studied how walker dialogizes the text of her novel with both social context of the time and her own life. through creating hybrid voices, hybrid characters and genre, and even a hybrid form of sexuality and religion, walker expresses her womanist ideas. i argue that she succeeds in creating a hybrid text in her novel.more than kin(d): building community and 
solidarity in arundhati roy’s the ministry of utmost happiness (2017)
 ■prathimmaya dora-laskey, alma college
arundhati roy’s novel the ministry of 
utmost happiness (2017) is heavily-populated with individual feminist narratives (anjum, tilo, gyuh kyom) that intertwine with the messy sprawl of india’s contemporary historicity. amidst these intersections of individual gendered precarity and national history, roy constructs impromptu alternative communities of kinship that embody donna harraway’s expansion of kinship in “anthropocene, capitalocene, plantationocene, chthulucene” (2015), wherein she famously advocates we “make kin not babies.” this feminist re-reading and reordering of the state’s apparatus and oversights in the ministry of utmosthappiness allows it to function as a cosmopolitan manifesto that problematizes the state’s proscription of gendered identity.
surveilling transness: postcolonial trans 
embodiment and the readerly gaze
 ■aqdas aftab, university of maryland
my paper argues for a postcolonial 
trans hermeneutic that subverts the surveillant readerly cisgaze upon trans of color narratives. by reading nurrudin farah’s “maps” through a trans lens, i conceptualize postcolonial gender transition as always already interlinked with geographical, national, temporal, and spatial transitions. even though “maps” is not explicitly about trans identity, i argue that the novel’s form (with its changing pronouns) and its meditative narrations of relationality, being, and becoming gesture towards a decolonial trans theory, which positions transness as closely informed by and intersecting with trans-ageing, trans-reality, tran(s-a)nimalities, trans-embodiment, and trans-nationalism.saturday, november 10

migrants and transnational families in a digital age
5:00pm - 6:15pm
room 204-205 (lcd)
anchored in the lives of filipina migrants 
and their families in the philippines, this book makes visible the various forms of care work required in the maintenance of the transnational family; demonstrating just how many people are uniquely affected by migration and separation. in accordance with subtheme two, the book critically rethinks how members of transnational families are actively crafting radical family forms under the current neoliberal moment that force their separation. it pays attention to how technology render filipina migrants as skype mothers while they forge solidarity among each other through their structural positions as precarious workers, undocumented people and transnational mothers. the book’s feminist and participatory qualitative research with filipino migrant organizations offers new avenues of collaboration towards movement-building of filipino domestic workers in nyc and transnational connections to liberation movements in the philippines. what emerges is a fascinating portrait of today’s transnational and transnational activists: migrant women.

in a 1974 article, cees hamelink argues 
that a new form of information literacy (il) is necessary “for liberation from the oppressive effects of the institutionalized public media.” given our current toxic sociopolitical atmosphere, il that denounces the principles of “neutrality” and authority is key. this paper will serve as an introduction to work in the field of radical librarianship which has questioned the libraries’ historic complicity in white supremacy, and which seeks to imagine and build an alternative space under which we  can begin to weaken the hold of cognitive monopolies.

historical trauma, national identity, and 
portrayals of sexually assaulted chinese women in the 1930s and 1940s ■lin li, university of wisconsin-madison
japan’s sexual violence against 
chinese women has always been emblematic of china’s historical trauma. my presentation surveys a variety of chinese-language sources in the 1930s and 1940s to examine how the troubling image of “sexually assaulted chinese women” became essential to the creation of a unified national identity and the mobilization against japan. though deeply critical of japan’s wartime sexual crimes, i hold that portrayals of “sexually assaulted chinese women” were highly problematic as they were simultaneously han-centric, patriarchal, and nationalist. i hope to explore an alternative means of understanding and writing sexual violence against women in modern chinese history.

this paper examines lan ping’s (later

beyond racial democracy: envisioning afro-
brazilian women in television
 ■jasmine mitchell, college at old westbury
in brazil, mixed-race women of african 
descent have often served as vehicles of the nation and as a vision of eroticized racial democracy. this paper looks at how mixed-race figures in telenovelas (serial primetime dramas) can point to possible sources of feminist agency as subjects rather than objects of desire. these paths offer an alternative for the mixed-race figure as part of a politics of afro-brazilian affirmation with an oppositional subjectivity in relation to the nation.
media and academic representations of bolsa 
familia beneficiaries
 ■gladys mitchell-walthour, university of

during the 2014 brazilian presidential 
campaign, some citizens stereotyped bolsa família beneficiaries as lazy people who wanted handouts from the government. bolsa família is a conditional cash transfer program for low income brazilians. seventy-three percent of those receiving bolsa família are black and brown and 68% of bolsa família households are headed by black and brown women (arruda 2014). i examine how beneficiaries were stereotyped in print media, academic journals, and social media. although most print and academic discussion focused on class, i argue that these portrayals are racialized and stereotypes of afro-brazilian women in social media were explicitly racist.
independent lenses: practices of looking in 
afro-brazilian film ■reighan gillam, university of

this presentation examines a film that 
represents the racialized struggles of black children as well as depicts their pathways towards discerning racial dynamics in brazil. the film jennifer by renato candido focuses on the racialized and gendered experiences of an afro-brazilian girl as she forms her identity and view herself in a society that values whiteness as a visual norm. this film shows how afro-brazilian girls’ visions of their own beauty are formed in relation to a visual terrain that associates whiteness with beauty. the film demonstrates how girls can move beyond this to value their blackness and their own looks.
protagonism of black women in  
brazilian education
 ■ivanilda amado cardoso, georgia  
state university
in the 20th century, public health 
officials used schools to implant the brazilian national civilization and progress project based on eugenics theories ( dávila 2006). in this paper, i’ll problematize how brazilian racism has made the framework of teachers. despite the historical process of exclusion of black women, we have identified that black women are protagonists in pedagogy, especially after democratization policies in higher education. law 10.639/ 03, (which requires schools to african and afro-brazilian history) allows black women to continue playing a major role in education as they use it as a political and strategic choice to develop antiracist pedagogy.

unabated, a number of countries, including britain, argentina, ireland, new zealand and the uae have implemented, or are considering implementing, a private sponsorship initiative based on a canadian model introduced in the late 1970s. based on qualitative interviews conducted with sponsors and advocates involved in resettling lgbtq+ and syrian refugees in canada, this paper critically explores the interplay of vulnerability and philanthropy that mark some lives and bodies as recipients and providers of care. at stake is the way that technologies of affect simultaneously reveal and obscure a global geopolitics of im/mobility.
disrupting state logics of vulnerability and 
protection
 ■leifa mayers, grand valley state university
in the weeks leading up to the 
government shutdown and eventual 5-year reauthorization of children’s health insurance program (chip) funding 233
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: saturday, november 10in january 2018, much was made 
of the republican efforts to pit health care provisions against deportation protections afforded by deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca). if this recent clamor over the (failed) protection of (differently) deserving children is understood not as a signal of welfare state ‘emergency’ but as a mechanism for the (re)production and management of ‘vulnerable’ subjects, i argue, regulatory state logics of vulnerability and protection may be disrupted and supplanted by social and economic justice frameworks.
“this pain, it gives us strength.” mobilizing 
vulnerability as resistance in the caravan of the mothers of disappeared migrants
 ■lisa mclean, george mason university
every year a group of central american 
women embark on a caravan through mexico in search of their family members who have gone missing while attempting to reach the united states. this paper argues that during the caravan, the women mobilize their personal experiences of vulnerability as a mode of resistance in order to challenge the erasure of their missing loved ones by naming both the victims of forced disappearance and the conditions that allow this violence to persist. in these spaces, the women cultivate political solidarities and build networks of mutual aid and collective agency.
challenging “americans are dreamers, too”: 
undocumented youth’s feminist and queer mobilizations of precarity
 ■katie oliviero, dickinson college
intersectional binaries of innocence 
and culpability, deserving and undeserving, again dominate immigration controversies. deployed across the political spectrum, these debates tiredly explore whether a pathway to citizenship for undocumented youth will incentivize future groups to migrate without authorization, undercutting supposedly-worthy american citizens’ already-vulnerable socioeconomic rights. dreamers challenge these zero-sum dichotomies through queer, feminist coalitional politics pivoting around 1)highlighting the transnational forces creating systemic precarity for citizens and migrants 2)demanding a “clean” dream act that isn’t conditioned upon criminalizing their families and communities; 3)strategically leveraging their sympathetic status to expose the human rights and legal violations ostensibly less-deserving unauthorized migrants face.

anti-rape activism and hashtag 
feminism: imagining justice in the age of #metoo/#timesup
 ■maria bevacqua, minnesota state university
#metoo/#timesup have received 
unprecedented attention since the use of the hashtags in 2017-2018 in solidarity with those reporting sexual assault and harassment. this paper analyzes the movement historically, using research on anti-rape activism that began in 1970. it will place #metoo/#timesup in context to demonstrate the movement’s evolution over time using archival research and media analysis. this paper will explore #metoo/#timesup as a contemporary engagement of the revolutionary anti-rape activism of the past and theorize what must be done to maintain the momentum of the hashtags that have taken on a life of their own.
the unfinished revolution: early feminist 
visions of a world free from sexual harassment
 ■carrie n. baker, smith college
socialist feminists in the 1970s analyzed 
sexual harassment as a product of the intersection of sexism, racism and capitalism, and they envisioned alternative futures free from sexual coercion and harassment. these futures envisioned a transformation of the frameworks of society that challenged dominant truths and confronted settler colonial logics. this paper explores these transformative visions of early activists, why they went unfulfilled, and how they might inform the current moment of revolution against sexual assault and harassment.

testimony during the 1991 hill-thomas hearings paved the way for the feminist movement against sexual harassment to be expanded and reframed today. comparing the reactions to the hill-thomas hearings and donald trump’s election to the presidency, this paper argues that generational and cultural shifts in public discourse have  created new potentialities for  societal transformation.
the value of silence breaking: online student 
activism as legitimate action
 ■laura c schultz, minnesota state university
students who are engaged in campus 
anti-rape activism have had wide-ranging responses to the movement that hashtags like #metoo and #timesup represent. for many students, social media is a central component of their activism. some have used these and other hashtags as ways to raise awareness about gender-based violence, abuse, and harassment; to dialogue with folks about their responses to the movement, or as a part of a multi-tiered approach. this paper will explore some of the ways in which this movement has impacted students’ activism and argue that there is value in this kind of activism.

lesbian feminists have a history of 
forming rural utopias in response to capitalism and patriarchy. in 2018, we see new initiatives rising, such as “queer the land,” that are designed to respond to gentrification and the loss of historically gay neighborhoods in urban spaces. these new utopias are meant to be intersectional and more inclusive of the trans community and queer people of color. #ruralpride, a collaboration between the national center for 235

anticolonial-queer space making practices 
at queer visions at the world social forum: free palestine
 ■mikki stelder, university of amsterdam
in 2010 palestinian queers for boycott, 
divestment and sanctions called upon international communities to support bds. this paper responds to that call by discussing the project queer visions at the world social forum: free palestine (2012), organized by palestinian anticolonial-queer activists and their allies, myself included. reading queer visions against the backdrop of munoz’s queer futurity and mckittrick’s work on cartographies of struggle, this paper foregrounds anticolonial-queer space making practices that emerge under settler colonial occupation. it addresses how queer visions’ space making practices imagine a future beyond the settler state and simultaneously interrogate dominant versions of palestinian liberation.
camp outdoors: utopian space creation and 
revolutionary vision of lgbtq youth  summer camps
 ■meredith heller, northern arizona university
i investigate how camp outdoors—the 
largest lgbtq youth summer camp in the us—designs a utopian community where queer people are the majority and queer interests are celebrated and centralized. referencing berlant and warner’s queer worldmaking and munoz’s queer futurity, i demonstrate how this geographical and conceptual space structure encourages youth to consider “gay camp” as rehearsal for making and living an ideal, inclusive future. i also consider how camps imagine “revolutionary work” that actualizes utopian futures: is it work toward assimilation akin to duggan’s homonormativity or the development of queer collectivity reflecting intersectional feminist and social justice tenets?disrupting and reorienting anti-violence work 
through queer theories of time and space
 ■samuel z. shelton, oregon state university
advocates and activists in the 
contemporary anti-violence movement have a vested interest in thinking about temporal and spatial aspects of normativity that support many of the social conditions allowing for the proliferation of intimate violence. perceptions that victims/survivors are in the wrong place at the wrong time make certain people vulnerable to violence while predisposing others to engage in victim-blaming and rape apologizing. in this paper, i show why advocates and activists must engage with queer theories of time and space, which offer possibilities for radically different and non-normative life courses freed from threats of violence.
lbtq gender and sexuality in rural america
 ■sara noel querbes, university at albany
most of what has been written about rural gender and sexuality has been written about cis men and masculinity in the rural space and much less attention has been paid to women, trans, queer, and gender non-conforming peoples. this research’s focus is on lbtq experiences in rural life in regard to gender and sexuality that focuses on lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer people, while offering a critique of the way cis men’s lives have been prioritized in prior research.

living archives: black queer women  
co-conjuring a performative text
 ■taylor c scott, louisiana state university
this paper explores narratives of 
pleasure that emerge from black queer women’s spaces. i hosted a writing workshop in louisiana, where we generated a collective hypertext. borrowing from yvonne welbon’s (201 1) notion of ‘coming home,’ we conjured space for ourselves in the hostile us south. i argue, creating with other black queer women is not only erotic in audre lorde’s (1984) rendering of the word, but takes us beyond the ephemerality of individual performance of a fixed text and into the realm of futurity through ongoing revision of the living, collective text we created together, “baby don’t taste too soon”.
black queer flying love notes
 ■tiffany lee, university of wisconsin-madison
this paper discusses my collectively conjured project ‘black queer flying love notes.’ i distributed seven blank books to black queer people across three continents, asking each person to fill a page with something (a poem, photograph, single word, etc.) that represents black queer experience and embodiment. they pass the book to another black queer person. i will discuss the emerging patterns from what folks chose to contribute, and where these books ended up circulating. i posit the existence of a black queer diaspora tethered not by, or to a specific land, but by an entanglement of intimacies  and identities.

gendered torture: the case of rape and u.s. 
complicity as a state agent
 ■cindy marie lacom, slippery rock university
is domestic rape torture? while there 
are no legally binding transnational definitions of torture, gendered torture is increasingly considered in reports, though “domestic rape” is not. the u.n. definition allows us to hold a state accountable if it instigates “discrimination of any kind” which causes suffering or pain by a targeted group, even if committed by a non-state actor. i argue that classifying domestic rape as gendered torture would allow us to hold the united states accountable as a state actor complicit in rape culture and that doing so could help us to strategically diminish incidence and normalization of rape.
participatory arts-based research in sexual 
assault prevention: art and action to end rape culture
 ■victoria dickman-burnett, university

participatory arts-based methods (participatory photography and art making) in a hybrid high school sexual assault prevention program that uses literature, direct instruction about sexual assault, and participatory activities. this qualitative study examines both students’ artwork and their experiences sharing their art with their peers and with their communities in a sexual assault awareness month gathering, examining the implications for cultural transformation and moving away from rape culture. this presentation will feature student artwork from the program.
trash: performative resistance to campus rape
 ■shadia siliman, indiana university
this paper focuses on students’ projects of calling out perpetrators of sexual violence on their campuses (such as emma sulkowicz’s ‘mattress performance”), this paper explores why some survivors choose performative and improvisational action over conventional routes of pressing charges and endure being labeled as ‘liars,’ ‘sluts,’ and ‘trash.’ in locating the demonic epistemological strategies of this ‘trashy’ resistance, i posit that these students imagine a whole new system of enacting justice against attackers—a system which circumvents the human, and thus has the potential to truly alter the machinery of sexual violence.

how we share and circulate the concepts of innovation and disruption can reify corporate logics, promote nonprofit brands, or further grassroots activist campaigns. understanding innovation and disruption as concepts constituted by corporate, nonprofit, and activist discourses enables us to explore the powerful stakes their circulation has  
for the emergence and shape of

enacting resistance through transformative 
pedagogy: spatial and sonic disruption at the indiana memorial union
 ■lauren savit, indiana university
this paper considers a teach-in led 
by three graduate student instructors (myself included) as part of the march 8, 2017 “day without women.” we used this event to enact resistance through transformative feminist pedagogy at our university’s centrally-located student union. this paper explores how our teach-in countered the normative, neoliberal expectations of students by sonically and physically disrupting a large patio, a space normally dedicated to leisure rather than learning and activism. i theorize the event as a “counter spectacle” (negrón-gonzales, 2015), contextualizing its design and execution within the fields of performance studies and critical race studies.
imagined sisterhood: spencer’s “letter to my

 ■brenda martinez, university of texas

this paper explores how anne spencer’s 
poem “letter to my sister” inspired the creation of “sisters in conference”, a self-love, self-care collaboration of collective healing and intergenerational dialogue. the founding of the conference strengthens the relationship between scholarship and activism as an effective strategy for reimagining academic spaces by making language accessible for woc beyond the university. spencer writes her message in letter form to signal an intimate dialogue between herself and other woc, in order to create a public act of resistance. sisters in conference serves to promote the same message while asking, how can we continue redefining sisterhood?

building counterspaces of resistance
 ■nicole carter, wright state university
this paper explores the creation of 
counterspaces for and counternarratives by undergraduate women of color students at a predominately white institution where women of color make up approximately fourteen percent of the student body. the network uses engaged liberatory pedagogies (hooks, 1994; perlow, wheeler, bethea, and scott, 2017) to build community, promote collaboration, and raise consciousness. these spaces mimic what nancy fraser (1990) calls subaltern counter publics that afford resistance, transformation,

i examine how a group of black and

 ■daniela gutierrez lopez, indiana university
framed by anti-racist theories of “radical 
empathy” (caswell and cifor), this paper interrogates the intellectual-emotional practices marginalized communities enact as tactics of survival (muñoz) within militarized state universities. i propose that student activist groups’ collective performance of audre lorde texts across campus at indiana university-bloomington constitute radical forms of protest and care against the rise of cisheterosexism, white supremacy, and xenophobia in the current settler nation’s political context. i additionally contend that, learning from their students, academic departments could institutionalize (ferguson) methodologies that center the erotic in order to encourage the rehearsal (boal, sandoval) of decolonial, anti-capitalist knowledge production.

2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: saturday, november 10this paper examines the role of affect in 
yosimar reyes’ ‘undocujoy’ project and his deft critiques of american imperialism in “the ashes.” i argue that reyes’ use of camp, humor, and pain, mobilizes queer migrant affects that cannot be contained by u.s. politics. drawing from disidentification theory (muñoz, 1999), i analyze the ways reyes subverts cultural meanings and poses a queer of color critique against progressive immigration reform. his ‘brown’ affect, which does not advocate for immigrant rights, but ‘disses’ u.s. empire and the dominant immigrant rights movement prompts critical reflections on ‘undocujoy’  
 as a mobilizing framework.

499. why have there been no great 
fat artists?
5:00pm - 6:15pm
room 314 (lcd)
to be fat in the western world means to 
be visible and invisible simultaneously. in addition, art in the western world is often judged, and skewed towards the white male, cis-gendered, abled-thin bodied heterosexual gaze. how then do fat artists make space literally and figuratively in art and in the world? what are the multiple identities they occupy and how do those identities interact with and shape their art? this roundtable assembles fat artists of various mediums to consider these questions, and to perform and engage with audience members in a conversation about the possibilities of art, decolonization and justice.

aesthetic imaginaries, oddbodied futurities, 
and the role of prose narrative in  embodied justice
 ■susan g. cumings, university at albany
examining temporality and economies of 
specularity in three transgender memoirs and several pieces of young adult fiction in which one or more characters have anomalous cranio-facial appearances, i will demonstrate that realistic prose narrative (autobiography, autotheory, fiction for the young) does not have to stop at talking about injustice but can, through an understanding of the operations of aesthetic imaginaries (gosh 2017), stare theory (garland thomson, 2009) and the imagination itself (warner 1993, anzaldúa 1999, ferris 2007), displace fictive, misleadingly binary divisions (female/male, trans/cisgender, dis/abled, “normal” /monstrous), alter and expand crip and trans futurities, and move us closer to embodied gender justice.
resisting cure
 ■beth a. ferri, syracuse university
prinsessa (2010) is a film about a former cabaret dancer and masseuse, who spent 50-years in a finnish mental hospital. insisting she’s a princess, she endears herself to others (patients, staff, and the local village). countering her expansive and oppositional community, the hospital doctor recklessly subjects her to harrowing “treatments,” attempting to break her of delusions. drawing on kim’s (2015) unqualified humanness and lugones’s “resistant oppressed” (2006), i analyze how the film redefines humanness, creating space for a radical praxis of freedom. in so doing, the film juxtaposes the possibility of expansive futures with a violence of cure (kim, 2016).
autonomy and dependency: disability and 
cyborg futurity in recent science fiction ■diane price herndl, university of  
south florida
newitz’s autonomous (2017), leckie’s 
ancillary series (2013-15), and scalzi’s lock in (2015) imagine cyborg futures that reimagine disability and disability culture in ways that challenge western ideas of autonomy and dependency, experiment with gender and racial identities, and challenge neo-colonialism. as kafer (2013) reminds us, haraway’s cyborg always embodied both utopian promise and potential dystopian catastrophe, and is neither a heroic nor demonic figure for disabled people or gender nonconformity. this paper uses feminist ethics and disability studies to read these novels as offering a nuanced futurity that celebrates connectivity and uncertainty while challenging limits on human-ness.
neuroqueer feminism: turning with tenderness 
toward borderline personality disorder
 ■merri lisa johnson, university of south 
carolina upstate
feminist scholars have produced a rich 
field of engagement with psychiatric diagnoses in general and borderline personality disorder (bpd) in particular, ranging from fiercely antipsychiatry feminism, to affirming, ameliorative, trauma-centered feminist psychology, to a more multifaceted material-discursive-intrapsychic model of analysis. building on this creative, rigorous scholarship—while acknowledging the ableist assumptions that nevertheless mark it in significant ways—this presentation proposes an additional method of engaging this gendered and stigmatized psychiatric diagnostic category: neuroqueer feminism. a neuroqueer feminist approach to bpd will be  non-binary, post-oppositional,  
 pain-centric, and stigmaphiliac, turning with tenderness toward personality disorder as a neurologically-queer  intersectional embodiment.

“i see that when i am in school, i will have 
a good life”: performing schoolgirhood as embodied aspiration in rural kenya
 ■heather switzer, arizona state university
this paper examines how expectations 
for development as increased household security and community advancement in rural kenyan maasai communities produce “schoolgirlhood” as a new normative form of gendered childhood and how maasai girls enrolled in primary school discursively and affectively work to perform schoolgirlhood as future-oriented social action predicated on managing their bodies and minds in order to preserve their tenuous hold on school. evidence from over 160 interviews and observations with schoolgirls and important adults in their lives reveal embodied aspiration as operating dialectically to carve open new possibilities and reinscribe gendered regulatory regimes consistent with neoliberal capitalist ethos.
teaching empowerment: affective dispositions 
of gendered entrepreneurialism in new delhi
 ■karishma desai, rutgers university
drawing on multi-sited ethnographic 
research, this paper examines empowerment lessons taught to dalit and muslim girls in northwest new delhi, india. i argue that the international ngo shapes female subjects who are able to feel and express a future-oriented spirit of enterprise. these affective dispositions move girls towards aspirational regimes attached to mobility. future aspirations were fraught with hope for new possibilities, recognition of gendered constraints, and a sense of confidence about navigating future uncertainties. these lessons work to shape new kinds of entrepreneurial indian femininities and structure young women’s future aspirations along regulated lines of caste and class.
consuming new futures? ngos, sugar daddies, 
and gendered aspirations in urban uganda241
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: saturday, november 10 ■erin moore, columbia university
in kampala, uganda, young women 
who yearn for the newest phones, fanciest coiffures, and trendiest clothing – luxury commodities that mark middle class status for “modern” girls – have two avenues through which to acquire the resources they need to satisfy consumer desires: sugar daddies, or older men who gift for sex, and ngos, who provide their beneficiaries with monies and other economic opportunities. drawing from five years of longitudinal research with a group of young women who navigated uganda’s sexual and ngo economies in parallel, this paper explores the entanglement of sex, ngos, and young ugandans’ gendered aspirations for the future.

linking international resistance to human 
trafficking, sexual exploitation, and domestic violence: utopian project or feminist praxis?
 ■lisa s alfredson, university of pittsburgh
international movements to resist gender 
violence have often drawn upon international human rights law (ihrl). the feminist potentials of ihrl began with with the universal declaration of human rights (1948) with its core aspirations of justice, equality, and dignity for all. but recent and influential movements against human trafficking have moved away from “deep” feminist human rights aspirations for justice, toward a “shallow” (non-intersectional) use of international criminal law. this study reveals and interrogates how this underlying trend derails aspirations for justice which depend upon understanding structural links between different forms of gender violence, from sexual exploitation to domestic violence.
the millennium development goals as a 
utopian project of development: tracing consequences for women through a study of women’s programs in india ■prakirti nangia, university of pennsylvania
the project seeks to evaluate empirically 
a common feminist critique of the millennium development goals, a utopian development project. the critique alleges that mdgs have undermined gender equity by incorporating women only as mothers. to assess the claim empirically, the project traces the histories of two social programs for women to understand the impact of the mdgs on women-focused policymaking. it finds that the mdgs transformed india’s social policy landscape in ways that undermined gender equity. the finding provides empirical proof for the feminist critique of the mdg development utopia.

fault lines and resistances: the politics of 
police in lgbtq spaces in canada
 ■alexa degagne, athabasca university
canadian lgbtq history has been 
shaped by hostile relations with police organizations. over the past decade, the relationships have shifted as people have argued that the criminal justice system is the best means to protect lgbtq people against discrimination and violence.  
i consider lgbtq communities (toronto, edmonton, vancouver) that have debated whether police organizations should  
be allowed in pride parades, events  
and spaces.
toward a decarceral sexual autonomy: 
biopolitics & the compounds of projected deviance in carceral space
 ■raechel anne jolie, tufts university
this essay examines the rhetorical, 
structural, and embodied divides between the “inside” and “outside” carceral world as they exist within the intersections of racialized state violence. i use my experience doing bodywork in jails to argue for a sex-positive and embodied approach to transformative justice work. drawing on the work of prison abolitionists and queer studies, i argue that space, race, and sexuality interlock in significant ways in carceral space, and suggest that the feminist project of sexual liberation and autonomy must start with a rejection of sexual othering for the most marginalized members of society: incarcerated people.
“una memoria de la posibilidad”: urban 
activism, memory politics, and decolonial futures in guatemala city
 ■kristen kolenz, the ohio state university
in 2015, the guatemala city-based 
collective h.i.j.o.s. launched a poster campaign for the “gabinete de la memoria,” in which local activists murdered by the state serve as candidates for political office. by depicting indigenous women activists in the posters, i argue that the campaign activates the impossibility of their election to imagine community structures inspired by local decolonial feminist epistemes. in this paper, i explore the campaign’s use of “memory of possibility” (h.i.j.o.s.) to challenge the colonial erasure of histories of resistance and propose new ways of knowing, being, and governing.

foreclosing women’s studies: how racialized 
austerity politics threaten women’s studies and “public” higher education
 ■michelle corbin, worcester state university
in line with the k-12 education crisis, 
the corporatizing university is part of an accelerating neoliberal project fundamentally undermining public  higher education. 
i analyze how the implementation of 
racialized austerity politics increasingly jeopardizes the legitimacy and viability of women’s studies and other marginalized area studies and the intersecting social justice struggles  that such disciplines represent. 
i examine current social scientific 
research and contemporary institutional examples and analyze the ideological and structural dismantling of women’s studies and area studies at the level of institutions, curricula, and faculty bodies across our increasingly stratified and segregated systems of public  higher education.
imagining social justice in a  
neoliberal classroom
 ■vidya kalaramadam, william  
paterson university
at a time when interdisciplinarity 
is the future of research, and neoliberal framework the future of higher education, what are the challenges for feminist pedagogy and epistemology within the classrooms? using the experience of teaching at a comprehensive undergraduate public university, this paper looks at how the theoretical foundations of ‘women’s studies’ are in tension with the neoliberal demands of the institution. a key focus will be the delivery of ‘portable skills’ for market which is often in conflict with the pedagogical vision of enabling critical thinking citizens as part of enabling the ‘public good’.
reimagining undergraduate education: 
models for undergraduate research and internships in gender and women’s studies
 ■letizia guglielmo, kennesaw state university
this presentation offer three models 
for undergraduate research and internships and highlights opportunities for scholarship and activism that projects like this offer undergraduate students in gender and women’s studies. these opportunities constitute high-impact learning practices, according to the association of american colleges and universities (aacu), and are essential to undergraduate education, both in terms of their collaborative approaches to knowledge-building and in their ability to “reimagine the sites and spaces where it might take place” (nwsa 2018 cfp).
uncovering hidden figures: writing women 
of color back into feminist herstory and the feminist classroom
 ■jamie lynn palmer, university of georgia
using makers and the feminist 
freedom warriors project as key sources for students to explore feminist leadership, i propose that employing a teaching strategy of “uncovering hidden figures” is a way to employ both bell hooks’ community of learning as well as a student-centered approaches that destabilizes stereotypes of feminist spaces and history. it facilitates a nuanced understanding of the diversity of feminist leadership, theoretical contributions, and social problems where students are able to develop a toolkit of women leaders and bring in a more diverse slate of women’s social problems that highlight their own interests in the field.506. struggles over food and water

what influences the decisions of native 
hawai’ians and non-native hawai’ians to participate or not in the production and consumption of organic agriculture?i completed an ethnography examining the overarching aspects of food sovereignty, including the accessibility of organic agriculture to native hawaiians on the big island of hawai’i. i studied the relationships between natives and non-natives to food sovereignty, and paid attention to both the broader context of a postcolonial society and the more local context of community-based agriculture and developmental organizations.  
i determined a clear divide between  
the indigenous population and permaculturist settlers.
take back the kitchen: a new agenda for

 ■peggy rivage-seul, berea college
ripples of a fourth wave of feminism can 
be felt around the world where women are organizing to resist the western diet of fast foods and the environmental degradation that comes with it. as visionary feminist resistance, take back the kitchen proposes a new agenda for feminist movement—one that looks to the global south for inspiration to reclaim the domestic sphere as a site for environmental justice. there women are leading the way to reclaim traditional ways of life that value the vital role women play in preserving health and the earth’s resources.
we do not consent: indigenous feminism on 
the frontlines of water protection
 ■kelsey leonard, mcmaster university243
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: saturday, november 10
the interface of law, policy and water 
management as it pertains to indigenous women is a question of environmental justice. water colonialism and structural injustices have disenfranchised indigenous women from ancestral roles of caring for water within indigenous political systems. in response to water insecurity women are picking up their ancient bundles for water protection and reconstituting traditional kinship networks. climate change activism led by indigenous women is diverse and as such this paper examines indigenous water feminism undertaken at different scales and through the lens of indigenous movements such as idle no more and standing rock.

in this workshop, we will explore the 
transformative power and potential of collective dreaming through a queer black feminist futurist lens. we begin with the premise that dreams, both shared and individual, have always been essential to social movements, because they carry crucial and critical information about how to make change in service of the future. the space of dreams remains an important counter-space and resource for our communities. we will discuss the ways in which dreamwork has shaped “black feminist futurity” or afro-futurism by centralizing the necessity of black feminist theory and radical movements of marginalized communities.

room 204-205 (lcd)restoring kinship structures that were targeted for destruction at the onset of settler colonialism in the united states is critical for the survival of indigenous communities. in fact, the restoration of matriarchy is necessary for progressive survival based on social movements worldwide. the story of warrior women reveals a mother and daughter’s journey as activists fighting for their communities over the past fifty years from wounded knee to standing rock. as documentary participant and activist madonna thunder hawk reminds us in the film “women have always run the show.” elizabeth a. castle will host a screening of their film warrior women about native women’s activism in the red power movement. this documentary film represents a collaboration of indigenous women including christina d. king and marcella gilbert. warrior women was funded by sundance and corporation for public broadcasting and will air on pbs during the month of november.

radical aurality: sound and song in harriet 
jacobs’s incidents in the life of a slave girl
 ■meaghan m. fritz, northwestern university
harriet jacobs innovates the genre of 
the slave narrative in incidents in the life of a slave girl by privileging the aural experiences of slavery. this paper examines the surrealist scene in incidents in which jacobs, desperately missing her children, aurally breaks down the popular opera song, “home, sweet home,” which instigates a mysterious vision in which the shapes of her children appear before her. viewing this scene as an afro-surrealist intervention, i argue that jacobs activates a new form of black expression in which the aural literacies of slavery and african spiritualism silence dominant cultural discourses.
imagining black futures from the specter  
of the hold
 ■ashlie sandoval, northwestern university
this paper investigates how designs 
for chicago urban renewal repeat the architectural logic of the slave ship. drawing from the work of christina sharpe and rashad shabbaz, i examine the architectural designs of the robert taylor homes (1962-2007) and the renovated cta wilson station (2017). i argue they exist as contemporary holds, staging futures where black bodies can rest only when such rest is in service of racial capital. in response to these contemporary holds, i offer a reading of the afro-surrealist figures in the work of visual artist brittney leeanne williams to imagine other relations between blackness and rest.
antillean afro-surrealism: engaging the work 
of suzanne césaire as a key figure of afro-surrealist thought
 ■gervais marsh, northwestern university
this paper situates martiniquan writer 
and scholar suzanne césaire as a key figure in the development of afro-surrealism. césaire’s writings in the journal tropiques locate afro-surrealist thought as an integral theoretical paradigm to understand the development of caribbean post-colonial theory. she employs this framework to contend with questions regarding post-coloniality, diasporic blackness, and antillean socio-political dynamics. my analysis of césaire’s work sits at the intersection of performance studies, black feminisms, and postcolonial theory. i position afro-surrealism outside a u.s. centric lens and recognize afro-surrealism as more than a cultural aesthetic, rather grounding it as a black diasporic school of thought.

ethnographic fiction promotes feeling

 ■jennie lambert, georgia state university
the question of medical discrimination 
of women with borderline personality disorder (bpd) has been debated by psychoanalytics such as phyllis chesler, clare shaw and jacqueline gunn. however, these scholars have not adequately addressed how to ignite activist efforts. my paper provides a framework of how to use ethnographic fiction, drawing from the works of merri johnson, kathleen stewart, claudia rankine, and charlotte gilman, as a way to resist psychiatric discrimination and supply a stigma-free future to women with bpd. ethnographic fiction supplemented by interviews of women with bpd will make readers feel between the lines, stimulating engagement about medical injustice.
sex cells: the politics of difference  
in biomedical research policy
 ■madeleine pape, university of  
wisconsin-madison
this paper examines the institutional 
processes that reproduce sex difference in the context of biomedicine. it focuses on the national institutes of health in the united states and their policies, announced in 2014, for sex inclusion in preclinical research. using textual and interview data to examine the historically and politically contingent process through which these policies emerged, i consider how governing bodies––and the broader biomedical research community––come to define sex as a key determinant of health, and sex as binary, biological, and distinct from gender, despite the efforts of feminist and other scholars to trouble  this configuration.
the helpful brain? translations of 
neuroscience into social work
 ■margaret f. gibson, york universitywhat are the many translations of “the 
brain” from the domain of neuroscience offering to social work theorists, researchers and practitioners? what do such strategies demand, ignore, or sacrifice? drawing upon disability studies and neurodiversity activism, this paper questions where hopeful re-designations of “the human” may be found alongside neuro-invocations, and in disability movements that challenge the dominance of “helpers”. using a queer feminist science studies approach, this paper examines how neuroscience is being used in social work journals, where multiple histories and purposes collide, and how such strategic translations eddy through the limits and possibilities of social programs.

crafting as a practice is ancient and 
current; it creates community and product; it is also a subversive pillar of many local economies. craft as a process has sustained marginalized and emergent communities as an expression of connectedness and as a countermeasure to oppressive regimes. in the postmodern crafting is framed by dominant cultures of “self-care” and whiteness, mediated by a rigid visual aesthetic that excludes black and brown bodies as self-sustaining creatives.

trans environmental ethics: an antidote for 
the anthropocene?
 ■lauran e. whitworth, st. mary’s college  
of maryland250
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: sunday, november 1 1susan stryker writes, “justice, when we 
first feel its claims upon us, typically points us toward a future we can scarcely imagine” (2007 , 68). in this same passage, stryker envisages a time when greenhouse gas emissions will become “morally indefensible” (68). this paper locates ecological themes in trans politics, theory, and film. it also highlights the work of trans-inclusive environmental organizations, such as trans and/or women’s action camp (twac) and the queer ecojustice project (qep), and argues not only that trans inclusion is crucial to intersectional environmental justice but that trans experiences and theory can enhance and expand environmental ethics.
living consciousness: on transness and 
blackness in the plantationocene and beyond
 ■dylan mccarthy blackston, hamilton college
martine rothblatt, transwoman owner 
of the biotechnology company united therapeutics and creator of siriusxm radio, recently called transgender embodiment a progressive step toward expanding human consciousness beyond the human form. rothblatt supports the philosophy of transhumanism, which is at once rooted in techno-immortality and eugenics. this paper examines how this suggested progression highlights ongoing frictions in how we theorize transness and blackness. as i argue, transness is always subtended by blackness, and imagining beyond the human requires an acknowledgement and examination of how black bodies and blackness continue to be instrumentalized in attempts to envision new futures.
conjuring addiction: transformation, 
transition, and transmogrification in edie fake’s gaylord phoenix
 ■kj cerankowski, oberlin college
in edie fake’s gaylord phoenix, a 
crystal pierces the thigh of the comic’s anti-hero, the gaylord phoenix. the caption reads, “an awful transform.” fake connects this scene to his experience taking testosterone. in testo junkie, preciado imagines a dependence on the process of change rather than to the substance, testosterone, itself. through a reading of fake’s graphic novel, this paper explores monstrosity and addiction to process, to the site of injection, and to the wound, asking what the needle conjures and examining how the fractures of time and the ghosts of trauma haunt the process of transition and (awful) transformation.

interstitial invisibility paradox: constructed 
invisibility of black girls in u.s. education literature and policy
 ■ayanna de’vante spencer, michigan  
state university
i will articulate ‘interstitial invisibility 
paradox’,the constructed invisibility of a marginalized group via a visible mythologized exemption narrative and process-based invisibility, for black girls in the u.s. education system. process-based invisibility, kristie dotson and marita gilbert’s term, refers to a predictable disappearance within public narratives (2014). the invisibility of black girls in mathematics literature and policy results from historical, non-accidental strategies that disappear gendered racial disparities (gholson, 2016). education literature and policy on racialized school discipline often ignores and/or elides gendered differences (wun, 2016). black girl students face process-based invisibility and exemption as a resilient, high-achieving sub-population.
envisioning a feminist future through an 
masculinist past: gendered rhetoric, historical narratives and the commemoration of north carolina student activism
 ■jasmin c. howard, michigan state university
this paper focuses on the activism 
during the greensboro, north carolina sit-in movement. i argue that due to the gendered language, masculinist historical narratives and commemoration, the subject (as in activist and the aggrieved party) that is discussed is often referred to in masculine terms. this masculine framing does not provide the necessary space to document the roles of women. in short, it leaves people without the necessary language to envision black women as subjects, both as activists and aggrieved parties, of the civil rights movement and in present-day movements. to properly contextualize present-day activism, we must re-envision our past.

from slavery to freedom: artists contemplate

 ■melinda plastas, bates college
artists have offered some of the most 
discerning work on the consequential ways tobacco has shaped our lives. this paper explores contemporary artists of color who radically illuminate tobacco’s significance in deriving and sustaining racialized gendered domains of injustice. through their critical engagement with histories of colonialism and racism, these artists imagine a future free from tobacco capitalism’s power to maim. artists considered include simone leigh crop rotation (2012), amada km pairing: dna (2013) and yishrab (2013), steve locke, carole (2009), and cannupa hanska luger and marty two bulls jr., “wasted” (2017), and hank willis thomas, blind memory (2017).
“it follows me, and i them”: black utopic 
relationality in “the end of eating everything”
 ■emily campbell, university of  
massachusetts amherst
in contrast to trends in new materialism 
that imbue matter on the molecular scale with unique potential for agential creation and resistance, wangechi mutu’s afrofuturist film “the end of eating everything” calls the cellular to mind only to markedly refuse to isolate black women’s subjectivities from broader ecological systems of which they are a part. this paper engages the film as an affect-ful performance of queer black utopic relationality in which self-reproduction takes the place of sexual reproduction, such that this racialized, feminized body births, not offspring, but rather a collective comprised of multiplicitous singularities.
leaky bodies: wangechi mutu and ellen 
gallagher’s porous futures
 ■majida kargbo, brown university
some of us are “too much.” too large, 
too thin, too freaky, too plain, too outspoken, too dark, too light, too old, too vulnerable. this paper explores the way artists wangechi mutu and ellen gallagher use collage to reinvision the black female body’s imagined “excess” as a site of productive possibility. mutu and gallagher’s collages keep our senses open to emergent and unknown forms of belonging and connection by creating a space for the viewer to have an encounter with difference that turns repulsion—what might, for a moment, be a desire to turn away from these beautifully grotesque forms—into longing.
monstrous dreams and monstrous scenes:

 ■tanya l saunders, university of floridain this essay, the author offers reflections 
on how black feminist, queer afro-fruturisic artivism (arts-based activism) has been a productive point in which to develop decolonial liberation theories. in the author presents the work of bahian monstrosity performance artists, and the work of afro-futurist watercolorist annie ganzala who are challenging contemporary notions of “human” in order to (re)envision black subjectivity and liberation. their work has implications for brazil, and the larger african diaspora in the americas. data for this presentation is drawn from field work in brazil (2008-present).
dripping in molasses: a black feminist 
exploration of kara walker’s a subtlety
 ■loron benton, university of california,  
los angeles
the hegemonic narrative of the 
always-objectified black female body is one that kara walker is interested in disrupting, reimaging, and to many critics, reifying throughout her works. while she is best known for her depictions of sexualized violence and gendered racism during slavery in the form of black paper silhouette cutouts, walker’s 2014 solo exhibit, a subtlety, marked a turn in her career not only technically, but also in scale and scope, particularly in relation to audience and historical specificity and critique. this paper contends that walker’s a subtlety explores the possibilities of repurposing the past to disrupt the present-future.

docile bodies, docile activism: colin 
kaepernick and the nfl
 ■dafna kaufman, georgia state university
in many contexts, foucault analyzed the 
ways in which modern western societies have disciplined society and the body. modern norms regulating professional sports manifest this phenomenon of discipline and control. foucault’s notion of the docile body and its relation to power in the neoliberal state provides an appropriate analytic tool for examining the activism of colin kaepernick—  
a professional football quarterback.  
using kaepernick as an example, i  
hope to demonstrate the manner in which foucault’s theories of the body and its relation to power can be employed to illustrate the nfl’s biopolitical regime and complete regulation of the contemporary sports body.
the biopolitics of bisexuality
 ■hannah mcshane, georgia state university
using foucault’s theory of biopolitics, i explore the constitution of bisexuality as a liminal identity on the fringes of humanity. bisexuality is a contested category both within lgbtq circles and in hegemonic society. the identity is commonly described as “half gay and half straight.” in a society in which “gay” is other and “straight” is the proper sexuality of the human, how do bisexuals negotiate a floating, shifting, and situational status of humanity? this paper examines the discourse circulating around bisexuality and the ways in which bisexuals can utilize their status as “half-human” to attain agency and liberation.527. working our workplaces:

in this roundtable, we draw on our 
experiences as student workers across multiple campuses in our state university system to explore the necessity of and contradictions inherent in decolonizing our student worker unions. as graduate students and teachers who engage with ethnic studies, women’s studies and gender and sexuality studies in our academic work, we unpack the tensions that emerge between theoretical knowledge production, organizing praxes and our embodied experiences within the university as a workplace.  we also advance a wide range of practices to develop a femme politic of care in our workplaces, organizing spaces, and communities.

the church has been an integral part

 a case study, with a black feminist standpoint, of the project’s successes and challenges will be discussed.

breaking the binary: moving beyond the sex 
wars in theory and practice
 ■corinne schwarz, marquette university
 ■aster gilbert, university of kansas
scholars of sex work in pornography and 
human trafficking have recently sought to work through/out of the academic framing of the feminist sex wars. citing a binary construction that pits individual agency against structural oppression, these two frameworks, while helpful in framing the discourse, limit the possibilities for thinking about the nuances of sex and labor. we propose moving beyond the sex wars in our research agendas and pedagogy. we synthesize theories that potentially reify the aforementioned binary; present sex work/porn twitter discourses as an actualized imagined future; and demonstrate how this knowledge production facilitates complex classroom conversations.building the exceptional outlier:  
academic constructions of the non-sexual transgender subject
 ■stephanie bonvissuto, stony brook university
trans (transgender/genderqueer/
nonbinary) individuals have often found themselves absent from academic considerations of the autonomous sexual subject. close readings of recent ethnographic works find the presence of a transgender sexuality either omitted as statistical anomaly or serving as the exceptional outsider whose stigmatized transcendent gender experience helps delineate normative sexual expressions and practices. i argue this presentation, void of intelligible desires beyond occupying marginalized sex-marked categories, reinforces normalizing cisgender-based sexualities. i turn to valentine and valochi in arguing for a future-feminist epistemology that would inform methodologies in imagining space to include non-normative subjectivities in sexuality research and discussions.

the institutionalization of queer theory
 ■anthony mathieu, simmons college
this paper explores the proliferation of 
queer theory in academia and its ability to undermine the subversive nature of queer praxis. queer frameworks are often co-opted by various academic disciplines in an effort to appear inclusionary and contemporary, while stripping the theory of its revolutionary potential. such institutionalizing of queer theory takes queer politics “off the ground” and traps queer struggle within the confines of academia. this paper illustrates the pitfalls of institutionalizing queer theory. it argues that queer theory has become an exclusionary site within academia which ultimately undercuts the utility of queer activism to radically dismantle genderist oppression.

 ■katherine von wald, simmons college
intellectual activism is a radical act of critical education. in fostering narratives and histories counter to dominate discourses educational practices subvert methodologies within academia which continue to marginalize and oppress. this paper critically investigated the production of knowledge within these institutions and its political impact. i argue that such historical narratives organize bodies through categories of sex, gender, desire, and race and can be conceived of as totalitarian in logic. i explore iterations of counter 255

corporate university
 ■wendy burns-ardolino, grand valley  
state university
neoliberal economics continue to 
dominate the operational mindset of the public university. this paper will focus on the ways in which tools of feminist economics can be applied to universities. i include case studies of feminist interdisciplinary interventions in order to reconceptualize the university as a community partner. i advocate for feminist praxis that deconstructs contemporary binaries (private/public, corporate/community, for-profit/not-for profit) using sustainable practices. i argue that a model for the public university hinges on abundance and altruism. this model allows for innovation, while requiring us to work collaboratively across disciplines and fields in order to connect with community needs.
i’m a hard they/them: surveillance culture 
and antagonisms with pronoun usage  within academia
 ■jenna l o’connor, depaul university
this paper investigates institutional 
neoliberalism through practices of pronoun usage. pronouns are meant to express individual autonomy over subverting the gender hierarchy. neoliberalism, however, mutates the intentions of pronoun reclamation to individualize and capitalize on subversive queer collectives. with that said, queer individuals are subjected to reductive procedures within academia around pronouns. this serves to simplify the queer experience rather than understand queers as complex, subversive collectives. ultimately, i argue that these institutionalized practices are psychically harsh for subversive queer collectives within academia, and reflect larger neoliberal surveillance technologies.

current work against ageism 
presents itself as revolutionary without adequately acknowledging and utilizing the work of our foremothers. this paper will correct that by discussing revolutionary thinkers/activists whose work highlights contested terrain in feminist history and renders visible politics of exclusion. central among these key foremothers and their works are, maggie kuhn of the grey panthers, barbara macdonald and cynthia rich’s look me in the eye,” older lesbians organizing for change (oloc),  and nwsa’s founding member evelyn r. rosenthal’s 1990 anthology women, aging and ageism which named feminists’ “failure to confront their  own ageism or to challenge  ageist constructions.”

announcing ursula le guin as the 
recipient of the medal for distinguished contribution to american letters (2014), the organization emphasized the power of science fiction “to challenge readers to consider profound philosophical and existential questions about gender, race, the environment, and society.” in “the space crone” (1976), le guin envisions an old woman as “an exemplary person” to explain to friendly aliens the human condition as a constant form of transformation. in my paper, i will pay tribute to le guin’s radical exploration of existential challenges and “the incredible realities of our existence”  in terms of gender and age.
the “inside” of aging: representations of 
elders in literature and art
 ■lois e. rubin, pennsylvania state university

indigenous scholar v.f. cordova’s 
“ethics: the ‘we’ and the ‘i’” and sylvia wynter’s “on how we mistook the map for the territory” provide a foundation for this inquiry within dynamic realms of poetry in relationship with science, technology, and relationality. seneca critic mishuana goeman’s emphasis on “mapping” is useful to understanding the notion of relationality, although she doesn’t use this term, which has been typically reserved for indigenous science. this paper engages poetry by heid e. erdrich, harryette mullen, and esther belin to pursue a reinhabitation of language, of the body, and of relationships beyond those of human-to-human limitations. 256

afrofuturism engages in a critique of 
not only the contemporary issues of blacks throughout the diaspora, but also interrogates and re-examines the historical events of the past. from negro spirituals, to the blues, rock, jazz, r&b and hip-hop, i assert that black music has always been afrofuturistic in that it has sought to “recover lost black histories” and “think about how these histories and cultures might inspire new visions of tomorrow” (yaszek). in this interactive video-based session, i focus on big mama thornton, labelle, janelle monae, and king as engaging in a practice of love and liberation through their music.

 ■miriam gonzales, pennsylvania  
state university
recent work in cultural studies and 
the natural sciences illuminates the vast number of material and cognitive connections between transoceanic bodies and spaces. drawing on the scholarship of sara ahmed, stacy alaimo, and anna lowenhaupt tsing, this paper highlights how tracing the transpacific affective connections between human and nonhuman animals and our terrestrial environments collapses certain critical distances between the human “us” and the nonhuman or subaltern “them.” rethinking these barriers, then, might also help shift intracrisis thinking away from resilience or restoration, moving instead toward urgent and necessary (but surprising) strategies for survival.
the colonial legacy of pineapple in 20th  
and 21st century hawai‘i
 ■mallory huard, pennsylvania state university
the grandson of christian missionaries, 
james dole founded the hawaiian pineapple company on oahu in 1901. dole has been celebrated as an entrepreneur and an innovator, but this image of an american success story obscures a deeper history of violence and colonialism, one that continues to have damaging effects on native hawaiian people and on the hawaiian landscape. this paper argues that placing the history of hawaiian pineapple in conversation with indigenous displacement, exploitation, and american imperialism in the pacific, is crucial for both a more accurate representation of the past and a better understanding about decolonizing hawai‘i today.
recentering islands: archipelagic optics in wu 
ming-yi?s the man with the compound eyes
 ■yi-ting chang, pennsylvania state university
this paper develops the concept 
of “transpacific optics” by reading taiwanese writer wu ming-yi’s the man with the compound eyes (2013), which tells the story of a trash island crashing the east coast of taiwan. in developing transpacific optics, i draw on transpacific studies and ecocriticism to analyze how the narrative form of the novel attends to cross-cultural and multispecies intimacies that allow politically privileged subjects to engage with indigenous and nonhuman ways of knowing. as a mode of seeing and relating, transpacific optics thus seeks to rewrite the power relations between colonial and indigenous subjects, human and nonhuman beings.

gloria anzaldúa (1987), cherríe moraga (2001; 2015), ana-maurine lara (2006), laura elisa pérez (2007), and maría lugones (1987) engage what i call hallucinating knowing or hallucinating epistemologies. they weave together conversations about perception, perceptual histories, spirituality, and decolonization. building upon their contributions, this presentation foregrounds “hallucinations” and their affective, epistemic, and postsecular work within trans of color, queer of color, and joteria studies. it underscores latina/xicana visions of decolonial thinking as they enact hallucinating knowing, an ancestral and intergenerational device against white supremacist projects of transphobia, heterosexism, and secularism.

reclaiming trans utopias? exploring the

2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: sunday, november 1 1 ■simon whybrew, university of graz
since the 1960s cisgender authors of 
science fiction (sf) have imaged worlds in which trans identity has taken the form of a futuristic or alien mirage. the recent publication of two collections of sf stories by trans authors represents a significant challenge to this legacy of trans erasure. in this paper, i will study the resistant potentialities of three of these stories. i will show that their exploration of the affective experience of trans becoming challenges their predecessor ahistoricity and offers resistant visions of trans lives that challenge traditional, teleological narratives of transgender identity.

 ■graham bancroft, university of cincinnati
the 2017 film blade runner 2049 is a 
dystopian science fiction film that takes place in a future of robots, capitalism, and patriarchy. the film narrates the life of a blade runner, whose job it is to find humanoid robots and destroy them, but who finds that the foundations of his own identity may be fabricated. this story draws on themes involving passing, performativity, identity, and reproduction. these themes are heavily tied to the trans experience, and this paper will establish the relationships between theories of the trans body/experience and the characters, plot, setting, and cinematography of the film.

(2016), the practice of teaching with emotions requires that educators refuse to accept the construction of the classroom as a sterile and objective place. instead, the expectation is that educators present to the class their full selves – using their bodies as sites of knowledge production with the political agenda of asking students to do the same. this presentation reflects on my practices of gender and sexuality “outing” in classroom environments to insert my own body into the curriculum, destabilize heteronormativity and reject the notion that diversity falls on our most marginalized students.

reimagining the feminist conference space in kentucky
8:00am - 9:15am
room 314 (lcd)
as a response to the rise in nationalism, 
the 2016 presidential election, and the lack of a feminist academic conference in kentucky, this roundtable speaks to the ways in which four graduate students reclaimed knowledge production from the neoliberal academy and institutionalization of feminist praxis. as founders of the kentucky gender & women’s studies conference (kygws), we will share our experience organizing a feminist conference space that would lend to academic and activist conversations, as well as solidarity building. last, we share our thoughts  
on the sustainability of kygws, both  
in terms of feminist leadership and  
financial viability.

annahs, infinite: fugitive painting, science

as imperial debris
 ■khairani barokka, goldsmiths university  
of london
multidisciplinary project annahs, 
infinite is a reclamation of potentialities surrounding gauguin’s painting annah la javanaise, exploiting inconsistencies in art histories surrounding likely-teenaged subject annah. i utilise theoretical openings inherent in conceiving of many possible annahs, including those of her as young woman who could have been in chronic pain. using jose esteban munoz’s notion of queering time to open up pain as queer, applying ablenormativity to notions of “debris” from ann laura stoler-edited volume imperial debris, i present how javanese mythologies usurp patriarchal narratives through my visuals-poetry performance installation as part of annahs, infinite [basel, june 2018].
the fantastic sorcerer: sound, black feminist 
temporalities and the african moving  image aesthetic ■portia malatjie, goldsmiths university

the paper takes its premise from zina 
saro-wiwa’s nollywood inspired video artwork, phyllis (2010), to contemplate the intersections between witchcraft, haunting and african black feminisms with a direct link to contemporary african moving image. the video, which questions the constant portrayal of black women as hysterical and as sorcerers with a direct link to societal ghosts, enable a thinking about theories of the spectre and proposes the notions black spectropolitics (in relation to black female temporalities) and the critical capacity of sorcerers, ghosts and haunting to function as metaphors for different forms of black socialisations and black female in/hyper/visibilities.

my five years of experience in designing and teaching “women, the environment, and climate change,” this paper will offer sources and approaches for intersectional analysis of environmental and climate challenges. one factor in the course design is addressing the powerlessness that students (and all of us) can feel when confronted with global environmental degradation. increasing historical understanding of the activism in ecofeminism and environmental justice can help foster a sense of personal agency in addressing environmental challenges.

alternative modes of subjectivities in 
journeys from syria to the united states
 ■leila asadi, arizona state university
as a feminist reflection on state power, 
body politics, and human rights discourses, i analyze preliminary findings of my ethnographic fieldwork in michigan among syrian refugee women to make sense of their alternative ways of subjectivity and freedom, and to explore how do they evaluate and redefine new ways of being, intimacy, while building community and friendship. inspired by louise lamphere (1992), i also attempt to analyze “the mutual constitution of class, gender and religion and observe variability” within, between and outside of my research interlocutors’ circle.
spaces of intimacy: passing as “french” in

 ■elizabeth anona bishop, texas state university

(1959) considered flop houses to be political spaces in which humans thrived among alternative relationships. she observed: “the heterogeneity of the hotel population makes it possible to predict that the solution to the problem of family life varied in relation to the diversity of ‘nationality’” (157). while the concept of racial “passing” seldom appeared in france, michel’s other work addressed working men who (after many years’ marriages to french women) confessed on their deathbeds both islamic faith and algerian identity, permitting reimagination of notions of both family and intimacy, outside social policy and the law.
women vs. x-rays: the gendered politics 
of workplace injury in tunisia’s gafsa phosphate-mining basin (1908-1937)
 ■rebecca leann gruskin, stanford university
i explore how north african women 
in tunisia’s gafsa phosphate-mining basin resisted the mining company’s attempts to monetize the bodies of the male workforce. as women leveraged their gendered “dependent” status to gain compensation when male relatives were injured, company administrators responded with technopolitical attempts to define ability and disability in terms that would suit their interests, most prominently through use of x-rays. gendered articulations of social difference and bio-political bordering were critical components of capitalism’s local articulation in gafsa. how did gafsa’s women imagine justice while litigating compensation claims, and what new imaginings of justice does their resistance inspire?

 ■andrés c. lópez, oregon state university
this future historicizing is an afro-
indio-futurist imagining of a post settler state reality in the americas. similar to octavia butler’s parable of the talents, a narrator from the future remembers and historicizes, through queer kinship networks and re-emergent indigenous knowledges and language practices, the events in our current time that led to the fall of the united states, a shift in governmental organizations and cultural norms, and environmental revitalization projects. ultimately, i use this future radical remaking story as an intervention to social justice models for change that disregard the temporal ramifications of the current emphasis on policy making.
lessons from kindred spirits: journeys in  
an earth-based spacetime continuum
 ■lzz johnk, oregon state university
in this paper, i argue that speculative 
fiction offers a mode of generative critique that confronts white settler complicity and demands ‘doing’ beyond ‘witnessing.’ this ‘doing’ is compelled by our belonging to a common “network of kindred spirits, a kind of family” that anzaldúa calls to oppose racist colonial heteropatriarchy and all forms of oppression (2009, 50). this paper will dream trajectories toward justice through queer-radical kinship and accompliceship imparted by kindred spirits across the spacetime continuum.

fugitive “texts” by and for fugitive scholars

at asheville
teaching environmental feminism to first 
year students for 15 years has enabled me to sharpen class-based critiques of sustainability and community engaged learning while introducing students to the maroon space of a witch’s garden near campus. in that space we discuss fugitive texts like starhawk’s the fifth sacred thing and octavia butler’s parable of the sower with our fugitive scholars--our community partners--the witches of the mother grove. in this women only space, students confront gynocentrism and explore the uses of “strategic essentialism” to forge global alliances with poor women while considering the privilege that enables voluntary simplicity.
claudia rankine’s citizen and othello: 
teaching shakespeare’s text as its future
 ■nicholas f radel, furman university
one of shakespeare’s most problematic 
plays, othello (1604) represents its title character as a dark skinned “other” to european peoples while relying on fundamentally obscene racialist discourses. yet reading the play in relation to questions of citizenship raised by claudia rankine’s citizen (2014) helps students see the play as embodying insurgent practices of racial re-inscription that seem to belong only to the future of the modern text. my paper is based on my experience teaching these two works (along with essays by roxane gay) in a freshman seminar designed within a cluster of courses addressing contemporary multicultural issues.

black girlhood, vulnerability, and magic in 
black women’s science fiction
 ■jalondra alicia davis, university of 
california, riverside
#black girl magic has raised concerns 
by some black feminists who question the political potential of its focus on glamorized, commercialized black femininity; ableism, and possible reinscription of a strong black woman narrative (hobson 2016). i look at black girlhood within black women’s science fiction as an alternative archive for a concept of #blackgirlmagic that departs from such ableist and superhuman implications. in black women’s science fiction, black girls’ practices of collectivity, spirituality, and ‘acting up,’ as well as their vulnerability to various forms of violence, become the very sites through which they enact magic as a form of insurgency.
for us, by us: black women understanding

numerous researchers continue to 
explore the influence of pop culture (mainly hip hop and reality television) on black women’s self esteem, yet little research privileges the voices and lived experiences of black women. this study examines how black graduate women, sista scholars, use sista circles to make meaning of other black women in media and reflect upon their own identities. the sista circles helped the women to interrogate messaging received from the outside world (e.g., parents, music videos, religion). these conversations provide competing definitions of black womanhood that has result in the women developing new understandings of self.
self-care is resistance: black women activists

black women activists are expected to 
delay their enjoyment in order to take care of others. this is an all too familiar trope most visible in the myth of the strong black woman, which, according to angela black, sets black women up for untimely death. this paper explores how black women activists practice self-care as an insurgent act in spite of narratives supporting their self-sacrificial ways. i argue that black women activists have resisted expectations of gender and race to prioritize themselves and their health, setting new directions and black feminist futures where black women activists, and their communities, are thriving.

in this paper, i explore how exclusion 
shapes the subjectivity of black girls. subjectivity is informed by various external conditions to produce discrete lived experiences (collins, 2000; simmons, 2015; cox, 2015). exclusion is not a linear process where there is a singular progression of events that lead to a specific outcome. rather, exclusion is a process that manifests itself in various ways to shape decisions participants make to negotiate conditions of instability and violence. i examine how exclusion -as a product of institutional racism (jones, 2017; ladner, 1970)-shapes how home and school influence the choices and subjectivity of black girls.
“i never felt so loved”: beverly william’s story
 ■ina kelleher, university of california, berkeley
this paper explores the central role community organizations play in the immediate aftermath of a child’s violent murder. since the 1960’s scholars have attributed the survival of poor, urban black families to their tight-knit social networks[i]. more recent scholarship, however, describes the erosion of these social ties[iii]. drawing on the experiences of beverly williams, a mother who lost her son lorenzo to gun violence in 2010, i illustrate how anti-gentrification groups draw socially conscious, newcomers into their anti-displacement work, thus providing invaluable resources to bereaving mothers, like beverly.

the (non) human in contemporary fiction
 ■eva hoffmann, whitman college
at a time when environmental crises 
endanger the habitat of human and non-human animals, new ways of imagining the human-animal relationship emerge: many contemporary writers expand the notion of family to include non-human animals and often add a distinctively erotic component. in this presentation, i illustrate how sigrid nunez’ novel “the friend” (2018) alters the reader’s understanding of companionship and desire beyond the human. the narrative informs our imagination of what forms agency and consent can take, and makes shared concerns between animal studies, feminist theory, and queer  theory visible.

spanish author jesús carrasco’s 
celebrated novel intemperie (2013) tells the story of a unnamed adolescent fleeing an unnamed danger, eventually revealed to be repeated sexual abuse at the hands of local law enforcement, with other community members including his father complicit in his suffering. the ending results in the protagonist abandoning all human society in favor of a nomadic life with the small herd of goats, sheep, and a dog. the novel’s unfolding convicts a community of patriarchal depravity which must be abandoned entirely for a livable futurity. theories by alicia puleo, mel chen,  and sunaura taylor inform this analysis.

this exploration of queer and feminist 
thought is catalyzed by speculative fiction and intersectionality (collins; crenshaw; mccall; nash; puar). focusing on the present relevance for diverse feminist thinking of histories of marxist feminism, french materialist feminism, and psych et po (falquet; guillaumin; leonard & adkins), the paper imagines an alternate theory universe with a history of ‘building bridges’ rather than political, disciplinary, and methodological ‘silos.’ a brief analysis of ava duvernay’s 2018 science fiction film, a wrinkle in time, demonstrates the value of an interpretive lens comprised of the conceptual resources liberated by this approach.

queer of color critique, feminist pedagogy, 
and my grandma
 ■chris barcelos, university of  
wisconsin-madison
what does queer of color critique 
teach us about feminist pedagogy and the feminist classroom? i analyze my experience teaching the first queer of color critique course in a gender and women’s studies department at a predominately white institution by theorizing disidentification, diaspora, and mess in the feminist classroom. by locating myself within the queer messiness of academic knowledge production, i argue for queer of color pedagogy as an insurgent practice to resist the marginalization of queer of color students, staff, and faculty, as well as the cooptation of queer of color knowledge in the neoliberal academy.
sex, sci-fi, and radical imaginaries from

 ■katherine martinez, metropolitan state 
university of denver
in her influential tedtalk on the “danger 
of the single story,” feminist novelist chimamanda ngozi adichie notes that power relations define the single story whereby those in power have the ability to tell the story of others and more importantly to make the story told definitive. one way to destabilize the single story is to tell multiple stories 266

tactical strategies for the enactment of

building upon maría lugones’ figure 
of the streetwalker, la callejera, and henri lefebvre’s experimental utopia, this paper discusses everyday practices of resistance against the mechanisms of sexual governmentality that regulate egyptians’ inhabitation of public space in the aftermath of the january 25 revolution. my presentation traces the emergence of autonomous forms of organizing against public sexual violence in the years that followed hosni mubarak’s ouster and argues that, in a context of increasing securitization and militarization of public space following the july 2013 coup, it is through everyday urban practices that other ways of being and relating can be enacted.
geographies and temporalities:  
markings of a revolution
 ■alma khasawnih, university of washington
what happens when we center 
ephemeral markings on walls, monuments, police vehicles, and military tanks as sites to build revolutionary narratives? this paper takes up these markings (graffiti, stencils, and handwriting) of the 201 1 egyptian revolution and connects them to locations, happenings, and peoples across geographies and temporalities. i do so to argue that these connections create new maps that disorient narratives of failure and end and reorients them to processes that began long before and continue on even after the streets have been emptied out.

nourishing pedagogies: emotional economies,

 ■cassandra hall, oregon state university
informed by my experiences as a 
neurodivergent and crip doula, i offer care as a critical response to the logics of individualism, disposability, and shame that engender insecurity within the neoliberal university. care as an analytic shifts the ways in which we engage with one another and ourselves in academia. further, care allows us to re-read feminist spaces and pedagogies. through an analytic of care, i articulate nourishing pedagogies. these ways of teaching and learning account for and act as a salve for those who are “violently un-cared for” and made insecure in the university (hedva, 2016, no pagination).
contestation and paradigm shifts: feminist 
classrooms as transformational space
 ■kali furman, oregon state university
in the next american revolution, grace 
lee boggs asserts that transformations of education need to move towards a “paradigm shift in our concept of education” (2012, 136). this paper examines feminist classrooms as a central location of contestation within academia where undergraduate students are faced with academic spaces intentionally designed to shift their paradigms of education. i argue the politicized nature of feminist classrooms renders them sites of (in)security where students embody and intellectually explore cultural and systemic forces of the neoliberalization of higher education, the contours of privilege and oppression, and the possibilities of creating new futures.
“hot commodities,” broken promises, and 
resisting disciplinary forces: re-imagining the disciplining of building the discipline
 ■andrés c. lópez, oregon state university
in “hot commodities, cheap labor: 
women of color in the academy,” patti duncan critiques additive approaches to centering women of color experiences as apparatuses that wind up commodifying the very people women’s and gender studies programs want to include (2014, 41). this paper expands on duncan’s argument to imagine resistance to the deployment of additive approaches as they discipline bodies, knowledges, and spaces in the name of discipline building. ultimately, this re-imagining of women’s and gender studies is an intervention to the ways that disciplining becomes the discipline and calls for transforming how we practice radical kinship through our work.
transforming space by “holding space”:  
re-imagining the production of knowledge  in educational spaces
 ■rebecca j. lambert, oregon state university
this paper examines my lived 
experiences within social justice focused non-profit organizations, activist spaces, and academic classrooms as public sites of social transformation. working to re-imagine these sites of knowledge production, i use elizabeth currans’ work on transforming public spaces and her concept of holding space to re-examine what these spaces seek to produce. currans uses the idea of holding space to be a “physical presence and a sustained, affective transformation” (2017 , 3). this paper explores what it might look like to be present “emotionally, intellectually, and physically” (currans 3) within such neoliberal structures.

embodying the fantastic: gender, race,  
and body in cosplay
 ■jeremy brenner-levoy, university of cincinnati
some fans of pop culture products use 
cosplay (from “costume” and “play”) to embody fictional characters from television shows, comics, films, and video games. embodiment always involves gender norms for dress and appearance, but in cosplay, gender is often performed in spectacular, hypersexual, or unexpected ways. this pilot ethnographic study, based on semi-structured interviews and participant observation with cosplayers in three fan communities (sci-fi, anime, and gaming) explores the ways in which sexism, inappropriate touch, and objectification manifest within cosplay. we also illustrate the unexpected ways in which labor, race, and gender are negotiated and discussed within these fan spaces.
“featuring five time-bending and shape-
shifting locations”: the purim shpil as visionary fiction for collective liberation
 ■kathryn silverstein, stony brook university
the jewish tradition of the purim shpil, 
or play, is rooted in carnivalesque logics that delight in dancing against the grain of established hierarchies and ideologies--the talmud instructs us to drink beyond the point of being unable to differentiate the blessed mordechai from the wicked haman. through an analysis of a brooklyn-based purim shpil grounded in antiracist, queer, and disability justice praxis, this paper traces and analyzes the anti-teleological framework of this diasporic tradition, asking how re-visioning (rich 1972) jewish performance can open a space(time) for creating feminist futures.illegible image: trauma, blurred time and 
bjork’s the gate
 ■kate lahey, university of toronto
reading bjork’s music video ‘the 
gate’ through fred moten’s black and blur and the psychoanalytic work of cathy caruth, i argue that the incomprehensibilities and incongruities of trauma, temporally, emotionally, and aesthetically, offer acute image disrupting capacities that are invaluable to the notion of futurity. indeed, it is the blurring, the distortion, the stuttering that trauma evokes that ultimately invites disruptive dreaming capacities. starting from a point of grief, loss, confusion and strangeness, as opposed to hope, definitive clarity and possibility, disjoints the affective projections of linear time that demand futurity to be a stagnant point of produced arrival.

“be pussy riot. it’s fun,” declares the 
russian feminist group pussy riot in the description of their video for “make america great again” (pussy riot 2016). this paper considers pussy riot’s movement between contemporary political crises and the cultural narratives that haunt them—between localized critiques of presidents putin and trump and the cold war culture that has inevitably shaped the pussy riot’s performance of the present. i argue that their deliberate foregrounding of us-russian authoritarian collaboration, especially through cold war aesthetics, proposes a resistant politics of ambivalence between hope and nihilism, nationalism and anti-nationalism, and the local and transnational.

inheriting values: disarticulating  
queerness, genetics and speculative reproductive technologies
 ■jey saung, university of washington
this paper interrogates speculative 
reproductive technologies that are represented by popular science as particularly attentive to so-called lgbt interests. these include technologies such as training somatic cells to behave as sex cells, uterine transplants, and most recently, artificial wombs. the discursive undercurrent running through these various technologies once again defines reproduction and family through genetic inheritance. this technological horizon fuels genetic fetishization at the same moment in which economic inheritance in capitalism maps wealth and privilege directly onto biopolitically legible families. interrogating this relationship would require uncoupling assumptions of heritable continuity from reproductive futurities and modes of relating.
an unthinkable archive of value
 ■nanya jhingran, university of washington
this paper looks at how octavia butler’s dawn and kindred can be read as taking on a historical archive that renders black slave women’s realities and insurgencies illegible, thereby vacating the possibility of constellation between the slave past and the neoliberal present. i draw on women of color feminisms to explore how butler speculates “black motherhood” as a site in which to think the history of reproductive slavery and colonialism together with racial capitalism in order to reproduce emergent forms of anti-racist and anti-capitalist insurgency that don’t fold into western liberal understandings of value, progress, or ‘the human’.resonate finely enough and many things 
become possible
 ■drew hereford, university of washington
this paper explores how n. k. jemisin’s 
broken earth series (2015-17) imagines a nexus between the endurance of empire and the reproductive body. jemisin thus opens up a historical reading practice that makes available not necessarily representations of alternative/queer familial structures that resist reproductive extraction, but rather nonlegible relationships of submerged possibility that cut across the presumed intelligibility of race, gender, and sexuality. this historical reading practice teaches us how to see trans-ness as embedded within longer histories of race and the technologies of empire, thereby discerning emergent socialities that remake the human within our current neoimperial conjuncture.

 ■adreanna d nattiel, university of maryland
last year, #metoo revived the national 
conversation around sexual assault; however, despite the campaign’s merits, it reinscribed sexism rather than dismantling it. in this paper, i argue that the confessions demanded by the #metoo movement function to turn female sexual assault survivors into proper neoliberal wounded subjects. additionally, the movement makes personal, harrowing experiences of sexual assault the prerequisite for analyzing the impact of these phenomena. further, it recuperates and enshrines male dominance by granting men the authority to legitimize confessions of assault.

“get me(mem)bodied: on memes  
and blackness”
 ■rahma haji, university of maryland,  
college park
this paper examines the relationship 
between memes and blackness. how does the discursivity of blackness inform the formation and circulation of memes? i explore black music, specifically hip hop and the subgenre of trap music, as a way of locating the genealogies of memes. i consider the affective, aesthetic, and embodied elements produced in the encounter with memes. how can we think about memes through the aesthetic practices of remixing? examining it through black sonic productions engages with the representational politics of blackness, authenticity, the discourses of appropriation, ownership (creative/intellectual labor), circulation, and relationality–both to self and to other.
“undead enunciations: zombie 
communication and black life in colson whitehead’s zone one”
 ■jonathan moore, university of  
california, berkeley
this paper argues that the living 
dead’s refusal to abide by anti-black edicts illuminates the psychic desire for enslavement that remains the inarticulable backdrop of black life. by juxtaposing the undead in colson whitehead’s 201 1 novel zone one with the protagonist—a black man who survives in post-apocalyptic america by killing them—i explore how the zombie, having embraced non-analogous life, might share its knowledge against man with the living black. i offer the phrase undeadening to describe the zombie’s redressive praxis of communicating with the living and the black praxis of attuning to the frequency at which the undead offer counsel.
“human computers and specters in/out of

 ■john rufo, university of california, riverside
this paper combines questions from 
media studies and black feminist poetics. in the 18th century, englishmen hired as “human computers” solved issues calculating longitude for transatlantic voyages stealing life. an alternate history may be read through m. nourbese philip’s poetic troubling of law/ocean in her zong!’s haunting computational undertow of undertones, which “cut[s] the cord of this storysound to rathse oba sobs.” as glissant describes: “the computer…does not create poetry, [but]...can ‘show the way’ to...poetics.” how does considering the technological backdrop help us understand philip’s poetics?

erotic crossroads: dancing female pleasure 
and ecstasy in (post)colonial martinique
 ■camee maddox-wingfield, university of 
maryland, baltimore county
this paper analyzes how women 
practitioners of martinique’s bèlè drum-dance complex draw from ancestral rites of fecundity to activate their erotic power and imagine liberation from repressive colonial logics. in this assimilationist (post)colonial context, sensual expressivity in bèlè becomes the conduit through which we can understand cultural reproduction and continuity. through an analysis of ecstatic and orgasmic dance encounters in bèlè performance spaces, i consider “fertility” as a metaphorical device, achieved in and through the synergistic interplay between women dancers and her fellow performers.

the cyborg we all perform: embodiments on 
the horizon in eugene lim’s dear cyborgs and blizzard’s overwatch
 ■keva x bui, university of california, san diego
this paper explores cyborg subjectivation 
in eugene lim’s novel dear cyborgs and blizzard’s video game overwatch as a performance that both enables and impedes possibilities of queer futurity. these texts oscillate between haraway’s feminist rendering of the cyborg and popular science fiction’s trope of the militarized cyborg.  
i argue that by occupying an ontological subjectivity in-between human and nonhuman, cyborg performances refigure racialized bodies into both speculative capital and fabulation: performative embodiments that—even as they attempt to enact a foreclosed, militarized future—maintain the openings of queer futurity by articulating alternate modalities of being (not-quite-)human in a more-than-human world.

the identity paradox: coming to terms  
with asexuality
 ■evelyn walker elgie, university of

in order to identify as “asexual”, one 
must opt into sexual essentialism, using sexuality-based language to navigate an identity that is fundamentally asexual. this paper investigates the impact language has when navigating queer identity theory, particularly asexual discourse. using foucauldian deconstructivism, it explores how cultural structures of amatonormativity shape women’s understanding of families, identity, and queerness, and how the language of sexuality-as-identity is inadequate for expressing asexual needs. most importantly, it reshapes our understanding of the platonic/romantic dichotomy by imagining how we might shift culture and language to shape caring relations that are not defined by sexual attraction.
flipping the ace: conversion therapy  
and asexuality
 ■sebastian maguire, seeking asylum  
& finding empowerment
several jurisdictions have in recent years enacted conversion therapy bans against mental health interventions aimed at changing sexual orientation. at the same time, the concept of asexuality as a sexual orientation has arisen, which would seem to indicate its characterization as “immutable” or, at least, a highly personal component of an individual that should not be subject to change efforts. this paper  
will examine the possibilities of using public policy, including conversion therapy bans, to challenge the pathologization of asexuality.  
ultimately, how far can the law advance society toward embracing diy sexualities that do not necessarily have an amatonormative, allosexual end?

 ■armaghan ziaee, university of cincinnati
in the early 20th century, the iranian 
state co-opted women’s so-called “emancipation” campaign by coercing independent women’s organizations and creating an official state-sponsored women’s organization. through a transnational feminist lens, this paper examines how has state-sponsored women’s organization impacted the fundamental complexities and conflicts which characterize the lives of women of different classes, cultures, and races in iran. through discourse analysis and drawing from archival materials, the paper argues that it was the privileges of gender and class that allowed state-sponsored women’s organization to speak on behalf of all iranian women and to claim a nationalist modern future for them.
the limits and potentials of a plurinational

ecuador’s political turn to the left, 
prompted by rafael correa’s citizens’ revolution, resulted in a new constitution presenting ecuador as an “intercultural plurination,” acknowledging the autonomy of indigenous peoples and calling for the inclusion of subjugated populations. this paper examines how the shift in political discourse has impacted state responses to gender-based violence in ecuador. through discourse analysis and interviews, i will demonstrate that although this shift has failed to improve the lives of survivors, political concepts like the plurination and sumak kawsay can lead to transformative legal innovations that incorporate decolonial frameworks, transitional justice, and andean values.new nationalisms in the era of transnational 
politics: a case from turkey
 ■ayca mazman, university of cincinnati
this paper focuses on ways the turkish 
republic and its current government framed and reframed women’s position in the society to create different brands of nationalism, pan-turkism, and islamism veiled as ottomanism respectively. while the conflict between the progressive legal framework and women’s idealized role in turkish society has been framed as a conflict between islam and “western values”, i argue that the causal-historical evidence shows that the democratic turkish republic is a natural extension of the ottoman empire, as the former embraced modernity and its institutions rather than making a clean break from it.
future trajectories for transnational feminist

 ■anwar mhajne, university of cincinnati
the aim of this paper is to shed light 
on future possibilities for transnational feminist projects on middle east politics. understanding the middle east, a region that has endured colonialism, imperialism, religious fanaticism, and sectarianism, requires a framework that illustrates how domestic, regional, and international relations have or have not created unique local women’s experiences. through reviewing transnational feminist literature, feminist international relations, and comparative politics scholarship on the middle east, this paper calls for an approach that centers gender in this scholarship to inform understandings of middle east politics, not just women in middle  east politics.

 ■kara lawrence, georgia state university
as a result of colonialism and 
hegemonic patriarchy, experiencing life with intersecting oppressions is extremely taxing. the added difficulty of being overweight, putting you out of the scope of societal attraction, can contribute additional stress in an appearance driven society. yourdictionary.com reductively defines fatphobia as “the fear and dislike of obese people and or/ obesity” (yourdictionary.com). the term is not acknowledged in more credible dictionaries such as merriam-webster or oxford. it is my argument that fatphobia, along with the interlocking oppressions of racism and sexism, can negatively impact the expression of black women’s sexuality and humanity.
(non)ontological intersections: an analysis of

 ■bryana jones, georgia state universitythe lesbian identity in white supremacist 
heteropatriarchal america is highly marginalized; the black identity and experience is similarly – and perhaps even more intensely – marginalized due to the deeply-oppressive nature  of racism. furthermore, those who have multiple marginalized identities are subjected to intersectionally-operating oppressions. thus, the masculine, woman-identified black lesbian –  the stud – disrupts america’s hegemonic constructions by presenting and performing outside the categories  of normativity. as such, she continually negotiates homophobia, racism, and hegemonic constructions of gender expression. i argue that although this performance is self-affirming,  ultimately, it epistemologically  eliminates her ontology.

gay bars as historical white space: public

research suggests black lesbians have 
a higher prevalence of alcohol use than white lesbians (jeong, veldhuis, aranda, and hughes 2016). however, there is little documentation of alcohol use across the life course for black lesbians, particularly noting illusions of public safety and subsequent intimacies involving the gay bar. this paper therefore seeks to address gaps in the life course literature utilizing an abolitionist framework. i introduce linked lives to highlight the sociohistorical implications of alcohol use, and map a timeline of historical trajectories to illustrate the emotional intimacies involved with public drinking spaces for black queer(ed) bodies.

“willfulness as working around”: devising

 ■elise verzosa hurley, illinois state university
although the difficulties of navigating the 
academic terrain is well-documented, it presents specific hurdles and pitfalls that cannot simply be overcome by conventional notions of meritocracy--and this is especially true for academics from marginalized groups. this paper frames willfulness as a techne--or an art of becoming crafty and devising alternative means of inventing new social possibilities (ahmed, 2014; atwill, 1998). focusing on the ways in which “willfulness as working around“ has been deployed in academic contexts—in the classroom or in departmental and/or institutional politics, etc.—i argue that feminist insurgent practices must consider alternative and wayward paths to disrupting academic culture.
“willfulness as embodied presence”:  
the insurgent body
 ■erica cirillo-mccarthy, middle tennessee 
state university
embodied presence has a long history 
in provoking social change through marches, picket lines, and protests. acting as a willful presence in academia—defined on a spectrum that moves from simply showing up to engaging in coalition—calls attention to who is absent, including which bodies are legitimized and which are stigmatized, in an effort to advocate for greater inclusivity. drawing upon survey responses, this paper identifies the feminist insurgent practice of embodied presence as an actionable form of willfulness that resists a monolithic conception of legitimized bodies in higher education, and by doing so, has the potential to shift realities.
willfulness as rhetorical”: repetition and 
critical questioning
 ■amanda wray, university of north  
carolina asheville
as a rhetorical response to 
microaggressions, repetition and critical questioning are two insurgent practices that involve devising behaviors and / or language practices to make sexism and discrimination more visible to repeat offenders and bystanders. the repetition of one’s response to the same behavior often gets coded as “willful” and “not a team player” but, as many of our research participants suggest, over time such modeling of willfulness can invite coalition, thus encouraging others to speak up and to complicate assumptions about who the “usual suspects” are that complain about sexism.

trans/national insurgencies in palestinian 
women’s literature
 ■therese saliba, evergreen state college
teaching palestinian literature is an 
insurgent practice, as palestinians often continue to be denied “permission to narrate” (said). this paper examines two coming of age stories by palestinian women writers, both inside and outside (the diaspora). sahar khalifeh’s the end of spring and randa jarrar’s a map of home highlight the urgent issues of refugeeism and home/land within stories of youth’s emergent sexuality, identity, and resistance—to occupation, war, the patriarchal family, the corruption of elites, and geographies of separation. using feminist pedagogies, i explore how these narratives complicate understandings of trans/nationalism through forms of gendered and feminist subterfuge.

“you ruined the movie!” black girl intruders 
in the white imagination
 ■briana ellerbe, university of  
southern california
drawing on concepts of the civic 
imagination, afro-futurism, and feminist theory, this project focuses on resistance to casting biracial characters in hollywood films, including spiderman: homecoming (2017), the hunger games (2012), and a wrinkle in time (2018). an analysis of racist reactions shows that casting biracial actresses is often met with anger for the so-called ruining of classic imagined white girlhood or womanhood. it is argued that cultural attempts to imagine more diverse or equitable futures must contend with the hegemonic imagination. the implications of these case studies within the wider realm of imagining futures for black girlhood is considered.
monstrous families and queer children  
in the post-twilight era
 ■sara austin, university of connecticut
critics have discussed the cullens from 
stephanie meyer’s twilight saga as a fulfillment of hetero-patriarchal norms, yet, the cullens also rewrite expectations for female adolescence, opening new narrative possibilities for the relationships between monstrously sexual or queer young people and adults. the cullens’ monstrous parenting model embraces the bodily autonomy of young people through queer family structure. post-twilight fiction vamperina ballerina (2017) and the vampire diaries (2009) expand this model by embracing the queer desires inherent in vampire fiction. fan studies scholars also suggest that these models increase the acceptance of real teens and children.
picturing queer childhoods: a study of 
queerness in children’s picture books
 ■jennifer lynn miller, university of texas  
at arlington
recent queer children’s literature, 
including newman’s the boy who cried fabulous (2004) and ewert’s 10,000 dresses (2008), reject adultist logics that justify policing children’s gender and sexuality. these texts resist romanticizing childhood as a state of sexual (and genital) ignorance. informed by queer studies, childhood studies, and narrative theory, this interpretive project identifies and theorizes counter-hegemonic visions of children and childhood in several recent lgbtq* children’s picture books. the term “queer love” is introduced to theorize the political potential of queer childhood intimacy, sociality, and identity performativity through an analysis of gender creativity, chosen families, and queer affirming hetero-family units.603. temporalities of feminist

contaminated by empathy: a condition of 
porous bodies and overflowing histories in larissa lai’s saltfish girl
 ■sunhay you, university of michigan
in saltfish girl, an illness spreads that 
induces people to remember histories that are not their own. miranda is infected with the scent of durian, a fruit banned for being contaminated by chemical waste. embodying this neglected history of the earth, miranda’s illness, i argue, is one of empathy. the novel produces its own theory about how empathy functions through logics of contamination and overflow, as a condition of being too porous. bringing agential realism (karen barad) and economies of affect (sara ahmed) into dialogue, overflow comes to structure the novel’s utopian vision, as unresolved histories infect human bodies.
temporalities of past/present/future : 
reading the flaws of a post-racial imaginary through octavia butler
 ■deja beamon, the ohio state university
in the novels kindred and parable of 
the sower, octavia e. butler presents temporalities that critique the notion of futurity as imminent. by using butler’s temporal moves in conjunction with christina sharpe, i think through the black/white biracial subject as the “future embodied” in post-racial imaginings of the future. in debunking this claim, the temporality of the slash becomes a space to theorize both the binary of black/white as well as the subjecthood/fragmented nature of a future predicated on racialized individuals that are always fleeting in time and space.

linda, the “doubly southern,” vietnamese 
american protagonist of monique truong’s novel bitter in the mouth uses textual “eruptions” (jennifer ho) to forcibly disturb the u.s.a.’s national disavowal of the violence perpetrated both at home and transnationally against female, racialized bodies. within the novel, linda’s textual practices expose truths otherwise unspeakable in her white, southern community. and at the heart of truong’s textual intervention, linda represents a future that is already present, a textual eruption that forces the u.s. to reconcile its estranged transnational and domestic narratives, and imagine new/old possibilities for what counts as southern, asian, and american.
imaginaries of inter-dependence: resisting 
extractivist colonization and ableism in 98 segundos sin sombra
 ■mary renda, university of michigan
the discourse of natural resource 
extractivism promises a better future in exchange for the violence of the present. this generalized promise obscures the colonizing logic buried within extractivism that disproportionately impacts racialized, gendered subjects. in 98 segundos sin sombra (98 seconds without shadow), genoveva, a 16-year-old girl living in a coca-producing zone in bolivia, resists the extractivist violence she experiences through consistently establishing intimacy with human and non-human subjects. this radical imaginary centering networks of inter-dependence subverts colonial depictions of racialized subjects as debilitated and dependent, as well as ableist aspirations that esteem a future goal of self-sufficiency and independence.

this paper showcases resistant 
performances against the settler logics and tactics shared between the u.s. and israel, looking particularly at palestinian and puerto rican coalition building. the paper analyzes the struggles against colonial violence and examines how they have revived the political actors, discourses, and locations central to the critiques of u.s. power made at the height of the puerto rican solidarity movement in the late 1970s. this panelist draws from work on the relationships between memory, visibility, and performance (shohat 2006; ahmed 2017) to examine their role in these comparative and relational projects of anti-colonial resistance.

 ■jennifer lynn kelly, university of illinois at

this paper details virtual tourism initiatives 
that palestinians in gaza have crafted to censure and circumvent israel’s attempts to sever them from the rest of palestine and the international world at large. through performance, documentary, photography, and virtual tourism projects that simultaneously describe suffering and create joy, palestinians in gaza are combating both the siege and representations of palestinians in gaza as defined solely by siege. tracing the epistemic violence (spivak 2004) that too often characterizes international presence in palestine, this paper examines palestinian cultural production that rehearses, satirizes, and reimagines tourism and mobility across borders and under colonial rule.
marriage and other failures: the queer 
politics of palestinian women’s filmmaking
 ■umayyah cable, hartwick college
this paper examines how palestinian 
women’s filmmaking envisions national liberation through queer and feminist narrative tropes. scholars of palestinian cinema have noted how marriage has emerged as an allegorical trope for resistance to the israeli apartheid regime (gertz and khliefi 2008). this trope renders liberation contingent upon compulsory heteronormativity. filmmakers cherien dabis, zeina durra, annemarie jacir, and suha arraf reinvent this trope through stories centered on divorce; failed courtships; interracial love affairs; and lgbtq identity. these filmmakers transform the representation palestinian national identity by putting forth a vision of palestinian liberation that recognizes and relies upon sexual and racial difference.

pauli murray (1910-1985) was a

 ■ayanna-grace king, mount holyoke college
the education system in the u.s. is great; 
that is, it’s great for cis, heterosexual, able-bodied, white boys/men. the curriculum caters to these labels via literature content and teacher trainings. the effects of being invisible are seen in secondary school dropout rates as well as the school-to-prison pipeline. black girls need a space where their culture and their education are reflections of each other. when we outlaw the afrocentric worldview within education we confine black girls to unrelatable one dimensional learning making it impossible for black girls to tap into their potential while simultaneously stripping any sense of self.

african, and muslim country to embrace family planning. global advisors collaborated with national health practitioners to limit the fertility of poor, rural women considered responsible for family size and hence poverty (ali 2002; bier 201 1; briggs 2002; connelly 2008). their approach to contraception promoted ‘modern’ techniques often involving invasive medical procedures. this paper considers mahmood’s critique of agency, to explore how tunisian women’s responses – including large families, references to patriarchy, and religion - rejected state intervention into their private lives and complicate the liberal individual model inherent  
in hegemonic understanding of  
modernity (2005).
tibb ‘arabi: naqab bedouin women’s  
healing practices beyond the tradition/modernity divide
 ■sophie richter-devroe, doha institute for 
graduate studies
i focus on alternative forms of healing 
among the indigenous naqab bedouin in historic southern palestine. tibb ‘arabi practices such as wet cupping or treatments against the evil eye run parallel –sometimes counter- to israel’s medical healthcare system. while modernist discourse brands tibb ‘arabi as ‘traditional’, ‘backwards’ or even ‘dangerous’, others celebrate it as indigenous palestinian resistance against israeli biopolitics. based on ethnographic fieldwork in the naqab, i argue that indigenous healing practices go beyond the binaries of ‘modernity/tradition’ and/or ‘resistance/compliance’. rather, they constitute hybrid informal spaces in which women challenge and circumvent state control over their bodies and intimate lives.
medicalizing innocence: feminist 
confrontations of honor crimes in jordan
 ■dana olwan, syracuse university
honor killings are often rationalized 
through political, social, legal and medical discourses. justifications for honor killings depend on women’s bodies, citing their trespasses against moral and sexual codes deemed sacrosanct. feminist efforts to combat honor killings challenge such rationalizations by relying on post-mortem medical examinations in the form of “virginity testing” and pregnancy checks that verify murdered women’s chastity and honor. in this paper, i examine legal, medical, and discursive challenges to honor crimes in jordan and how they consciously and unconsciously shore up and reproduce binaries of guilt/innocence and tradition/modernity on which defenses of the honor crime invariably depend.

let others be normal”: some trans*national 
queer sensibilities
 ■melissa m. gonzalez, davidson college
this paper explores how the writings 
and performances of trans* artists from chile, argentina, and peru produce cultural criticism on gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. sharing few theoretical texts or concepts, their insights nevertheless align with much of u.s. queer of color critique because of commonalities in the oppression of racial and gender minorities engendered by globalized social and economic structures. the work of these artists demonstrates how the university’s monopoly on knowledge production reproduces gender, race, and class normativities and expresses ambivalence about the problematic ways that transgender is positioned  
 as the vanguard of lgbtq  movements transnationally.

hybrid utopias and feminist futures in saya 
woolfalk’s “the empathics”
 ■anna storti, university of maryland,  
college park
this paper explores speculative 
representations of racial and cultural hybridity through the art of contemporary mixed-race artist saya woolfalk. woolfalk’s multi-year and multimedia projects “no place,” “the empathics,” and “chimatek” creates a fictional race of women - the empathics - able to alter their genetics to fuse with plants. woolfalk’s work imagines a feminist praxis of hybridity in a post-apocalyptic world. drawing attention to the entanglements of accelerated environmental decay and the endurance of coloniality, i read woolfalk’s work within and against narratives of racial mixture in an attempt to reckon with the linear progress narrative associated with contemporary politics of multiracialism.
“left-handed sermons in a right-handed 
world: triple-consciousness, the black woman preacher, and the sermon as literary genre”
 ■melanie r hill, rutgers university
in civil rights movements, it is the face 
of the black male preacher that has become synonymous with social justice moments. however, this paper brings to light the figure of the black woman preacher as she uses both sermon and song to tear down walls of race, gender, and class biases. focusing on the intersections of black feminism, literature, and sound studies, the black woman preacher’s sermons of forward movement speak to the vision of not just imagining justice but claiming justice and visions of freedom.
surrogating sister rosetta: shingai shoniwa,

 ■kate grover, university of texas at austin
this paper examines performances of 
two twenty-first century black women musicians inspired by sister rosetta tharpe: the 2007 music video for “sister rosetta (capture the spirit)” featuring shingai shoniwa of indie rock trio noisettes, and rhiannon giddens’s 2015 rendition of “up above my head” for pbs series in performance at the white house. drawing on daphne brooks’s concept of “black feminist surrogation,” i argue that in these performances, shoniwa and giddens protest the historical erasure of black women in popular music while imagining new, feminist narratives for tharpe, an artist who has only recently reentered public memory.

 ■tamara t. butler, michigan state university
black girls’ liberatory practices are rooted in the spaces that we demand, seek, create, and cultivate. in this paper, i begin to outline “black girl cartography,” which is a praxis-oriented framework to unpack where black girls are physically and sociopolitically mapped in research. using a case study of education research published during the era of “black girlhood celebration” (kwayke, hill & callier, 2017), i use  
the framework to discuss where black girls cultivate care that is rooted  
in justice, respect, reciprocity,

 ■ronak k kapadia, university of illinois

critical queer feminist study has lovingly 
brought renewed methodological attention to long-forgotten, once-inhabited sites, archives, geographies, and histories, which can be newly reanimated for the service of contemporary collective social life. one such instance in present-day palestine is the international art, writing, and research residency called el-atlal (“the ruins”) founded in 2014 by french palestinian scholar karim kattan in the town of jericho. this paper argues that, given its historical heritage and complex station in the local imagination, jericho is a generative utopian site for enacting  
new incubatory spaces for alternative political and aesthetic possibility in the here and now.

a queer future in the feminist past
 ■leah claire allen, grinnell college
in 1974, andrea dworkin concluded her 
text “woman hating” with a radically utopian chapter titled “androgyny, fucking, and community.” this chapter offered a queer future for feminism, one invested in non-binary, intergenerational, interspecies eroticism as a mechanism for total cultural transformation. the chapter’s commitment to diffuse sexuality is at odds with other 1970s feminist visions of the future more grounded in revisions to women’s sex roles. its strange untimeliness suggests we must alter our history of feminism’s concern with sexuality in relation to gender. the chapter is part of a contemporary conversation about queer futurity, optimism, and utopia.
“picturing possibilities”: aids activism, 
disability, and the politics of belonging
 ■karisa butler-wall, university of

in the late 1980s, the gay men’s health 
crisis in new york city produced a series of erotic safer sex videos that embraced a strategy of “militant eroticism” to demand the right to sexual freedom as a fundamental aspect of sexual health. while the invention of safer sex by aids activists has often been celebrated as a form of political resistance within the queer historical imaginary, this paper investigates how the radical possibilities inherent within the utopian visions of queer relationality and belonging they put forth were constrained by their reproduction of racialized and classed ideologies of ableism.

 ■k allison hammer, vanderbilt university
in female masculinity (1998), jack 
halberstam asked what happens when “boy rebellion is located not in the testosterone-induced pout of the hooligan but in the sneer of the tomboy?” in 2018, this “testosterone-induced pout” more often presents on the body of a female-born child or adult, thus challenging misogyny, cisnormativity, and heteronormativity. medical technologies allow “boyhood” to occur at any stage of life, in effect queering the lifecycle. many transmen also refuse to purge all signs of queerness in “boyhood.” however, the concept of trans-boyhood has also augmented the resentment fueling right-wing populism, neo-fascist movements, and white nationalism.

while anti-sexual violence movements in il has increased the capacity of the state to process more dna evidence to increase rape convictions and administer justice, prison abolitionists have proposed the use of the human genome for an alternate utopian project of exonerating the wrongfully convicted. using prison abolitionist and intersectional frameworks, this paper questions the terrains of bio-surveillance (browne, 2012) using the human genome, as one that is utopian

assinajaq’s film three thousand as an articulation of both the indigenous longue durée and a world of entangled ecologies. combining archival film footage with original animation, voiceover, and music by inuk throat-singer tanya tagaq, the film insists upon the fluid commingling of times: the ancestors will have been in the future, two hands stretch out in either direction, traditional stories offer lessons for future generations. ultimately, i argue that more livable arctic futures are ones in which tangles of dependency and care––times, peoples, lands, and animals––are centered through radical forms of indigenous resurgence.

hemphill is considered profound for its unadulterated portrayal of interracial queer intimacy. this paper, in distinction, considers the ways in which hemphill’s speaker in “heavy breathing” narrates the constricting space of the bathhouse as one that produces a disorienting affect—the experience of alienation from black queer intraracial intimacy due to the scene of interracial pleasure. thinking with the works of hemphill and artist glenn ligon, i elucidate the disorientations involved in cruising as a black queer subject; the dizzying inability to mark the difference between pleasure and negation in a racialized visual field.

now; towards an eroticx of the choker ■amaris diana brown, cornell university
as a distinct, tightly-worn necklace, the 
choker maintains a symbolic history of bondage and discipline. punishment collars were enforced upon enslaved laborers who attempted to run away. these technologies of bondage restricted movement, comfort, and intimacy. amplifying queer subjectivities against the material archive of the choker, raises questions about the power(ful) interactions, reassignments of meaning, and corporeal remappings the choker has infiltrated within contemporary black sexual culture. the paper argues that within a social and material history of black sexual cultures ‘chokers’ represent a possibility for queer liberation that embraces nonconformity and disruption as central to black being.

theorizations of ‘diaspora’ to engage the artistic works of lucille clifton (1980) and reina gossett (2017). through the language of the poem i wish to extend alexis pauline gumbs configuration of the black feminine domestic, asking: what would it mean to claim the space of the atlantic (and beyond) as resting place? thinking with the images of the film i ask: how might the space of the atlantic be re/membered in the club, the dressing room and other sites of black femme self fashioning.
dilemmas in space: revisiting

 ■amanda anderson, emory university
in drawing from denise ferreira da 
silva’s recent theorizations on the capacity for blackness to exist––to matter––without form, this paper grapples with ‘formlessness’ as an obliteration of the axiological grounds which have rendered black living precarious. it turns to literary aesthetics, specifically toni morrison’s beloved, 292

with infanticide and the world of the paranormal offers a ground through which to imagine black women’s mattering without a stable body. it asks, might the formlessness of the supernatural be read as a way of mattering beyond axiology, presenting a new space, out of space?

the instrumentalism of artificial insemination: 
on nonhuman autonomy, consent, and naturalized sexual domination
 ■bjørn kristensen, oregon state university
in this project, i examine the instrumental 
narrative of artificial insemination in animal agriculture through the ecological feminist lens of val plumwood. i argue that artificial insemination is a violent act of naturalized interspecies sexual domination. sterile terminology backgrounds both the reality for nonhumans, and the human perversity expressed through such acts. central is considering conceptions of consent and autonomy in the nonhuman. i look to plumwood’s intentional recognition stance as a call to moral interaction which seeks not only to recognize nonhuman others as intentional and communicative, but also to intentionally engage in fostering new dialogical possibilities with them.
towards the inclusion of animal liberation in 
the field of women and gender studies (wgs)
 ■jennifer ann venable, oregon state university
although theorists have examined the 
interconnections between interspecies oppression, little concern has been devoted to examining what attention animals might be given in wgs itself. this paper investigates justifications for this omission by focusing on classed and racialized representations of the animal liberation movement. i am also interested in how speciesism functions within wgs. while embracing intersectional approaches to understanding and resolving human injustices, wgs has simultaneously upheld speciesism as a default norm through which animal oppression is rendered invisible. i make the case that the inclusion of animals within wgs demonstrates new and possible paths forward within the field.

 ■katherine fallon, georgia southern university
classroom culture often resists outright 
disclosure of queerness. this discussion will explore the role of social positioning, as the presenter, a queer instructor who is often assumed to identify as heterosexual, balances the public and private by writing a column in which pedagogy, feminism, left-wing politics, and queerness converge, for a small, south georgia city’s local magazine. through the lens of feminist standpoint theory, the presentation explores the relationship between queerness, education, and the written word in the depths of a red state.
“despite everything i said”: the contradictions 
of ‘passing’ in the south
 ■baker rogers, georgia southern university
are transmen in the south more likely to 
try to fit into the gender binary, challenge it, or queer it? i examine the implications this has for “passing,” transnormativity, and the dominance of the gender binary. rather than challenging gender, transmen in the south often uphold the rigid gender system through attempting to “pass” as cisgender men. in this way, the south differs from other areas where non-normative gender identities are correlated with calls for acceptance of queerness. this is likely related to multiple aspects of what it means to be a transman in the south, including privilege and fear.
enacting an anti-heteronormative praxis  
in teacher education
 ■peggy shannon-baker, georgia  
southern university
much of the research on teacher education focuses on the content of the coursework, students’ learning outcomes, and the long-term impact on students’ dispositions and future practices. the same applies to research on heteronormative discourses in teacher education programs. how do faculty engage in anti-heteronormative work in these spaces? what can such a praxis look like in courses on human development, classroom assessment, and research where the dominant discourse is steeped in the erasure of sexuality and binary notions of sex and gender? this paper shares my reflections on developing a radical politics of anti-heteronormativity in teacher education spaces.

“til women’s lib do us part”: humor in the 
radical feminist press, 1969-1980
 ■sascha cohen, independent scholar
the stereotype of second-wave 
feminism as devoid of pleasure, irony, or self-awareness represents an incomplete understanding of the movement. this paper examines jokes, cartoons, and comic strips featured in radical feminist periodicals at the height of the u.s. women’s liberation movement which humorously addressed issues important to women’s liberation, such as housework, motherhood, marriage, sex, workplace discrimination, the new left, and gender role socialization. combining the history of women’s activism with the study of affect, i argue that feminists employed humor as strategy of social protest and political critique, and as a way to negotiate internal conflicts within their movement.
ob tampons & national champions: satire,

 ■viveca greene, hampshire college
today the topic of sexual violence 
is more visible in comedy than ever before. this paper examines the works of three satirists--samantha bee, amy schumer, and lena weissbrot--all of whom have critiqued aspects of rape culture. just as rape jokes are constitutive of rape culture, we contend that satirical performances that address dimensions of that culture are vital to challenging it. however, our three white-presenting satirists do not always or equally address the centuries-old relationship between rape culture and racism. through critical contextual analysis, we explore their work with particular attention to lacunae within white feminism.
for praxis/for profit: black feminist humor 
in the neoliberal age
 ■jessyka finley, middlebury college
performance and black feminist 
traditions have long served as sites of resistance, especially for addressing social issues in ways that engender new forms of political consciousness (davis 1998). black feminist humor has, in heterogeneous ways, been a mode of critical praxis where comics configure alternative epistemologies of black womanhood. in this paper, i draw on (auto)ethnographic data, black feminist and performance theories to map out how consciousness, failure, empowerment, and neoliberal imperatives frame black women’s humor as feminist praxis in the 21st century. how can we account for black feminist humor, and what is its social and political efficacy?
whalephant, liontelope, and storkoise: the 
anti-colonial laughter of sukumar ray
 ■sushmita chatterjee, appalachian  
state university
 ■deboleena roy, emory university
widely read as an essential part of the 
bengali identity, sukumar ray’s (1887-1923) work exemplifies humor in the genre of “nonsense.” an indelible aspect of ray’s nonsensical humorous images and verse is the use of animals in-fusion. disparate animals are joined together to constitute new and imaginary compositions. our paper analyses the use of humorous animal imagery by ray to decipher its framing as part of anti-colonial and artistic movements that led to transgressive forms of political power. we ask: what might this particular mode of “becoming animal” add to feminist conversations in animal studies and  on laughter?
the sardonic, sustaining feminism of the 
guerrilla girls, 1985-2000
 ■kirsten leng, university of

this paper explores the uses and 
effects of humor for the guerrilla girls, an anonymous collective of women artists established in 1985. using archival materials, posters, and oral histories, this paper shows that humor was vital to the girls’ exposure of institutionalized sexism and racism in the art world. irony especially helped to render the exclusion of women and people of color absurd, and to create new feminist communities by affirming women’s experiences. for the girls themselves, humor provided catharsis and sustenance for their political work by liberating members from a sense  of helplessness and establishing collective consciousness.

transing the means of reproduction
 ■aren aizura, university of minnesota
this paper offers the frame of transing 
reproductive labor to highlight how marking the queerness or gender insurrection of reproductive labor in feminist spaces feels potentially vulnerable or risky. “transing” or queering is often understood to add queer subjectivities to a frame in which cisgendered women remain as the political subjects of care work. but this ignores how gender itself has been a violent colonial and racializing logic. how can we acknowledge the deep queerness of the gender embodiments, practices, and identifications that the heteronormativity and racialization of the division of labor obscures and violently alters?

care as undoing: rethinking feminist care 
ethics through foucault’s “care of the self”295
2018 national women’s studies association conferencegeneral conference: sunday, november 1 1 ■dayne alexander, emory university
feminist care ethics, as theorized in 
posthumanist, critical animal studies, and ecofeminism, deploys notions of suffering, response-ability, reciprocity, and vulnerability which take recourse to humanist notions of subjectivity. using foucault’s notion of ethics as “care of the self” - where “self” is not a recuperation of the humanist subject but a self-dislocating that allows the subject to “’get free’ of itself,” and where the self is a “form” rather than a “substance” - i reconsider care as a tool for undoing and re-crafting this “form” and its relationship to always implicated “others” with reference to rethinking the ethico-political stakes of interspecies care.

the success of this new model of education, housed within an independent academic center, productively queers the university by working to de-mystify the components of institutional privilege such as social capital and economic hierarchies that correlate with academic success. however, i also contend that this system reinforces a differential value on forms of educational labor wherein traditional (inter)disciplines need not concern themselves with the opaqueness

ecofeminist pedagogies consider how

racialized, gendered, and colonial violence and domination as well as prefigure our utopian visions, by drawing from speculative fiction? troubled by carceral feminist solutions to violence, i explore alternatives to the criminal justice system as a form of redress. while there is already a wide array of feminist theory around violence,[1] my research is additionally informed by afro-futurism and feminist science fiction. using these perspectives as inspiration, i suggest we envision a feminist futurity—a world centered around survivor-led transformative justice—through the novels of octavia butler and ursula le guin.[2]
knitting out of the box: anticarceral 
domesticity and the radical imaginaries of prison knitting
 ■pamela wynne butler, university of  
notre dame
as coerced labor, therapeutic 
intervention, and a way to pass time while doing time, prison knitting in the us has frustrated foundational binaries of racial capitalism—labor/leisure, feminine/masculine, consumption/production. after surveying this history, i use interviews with prisoners to argue that contemporary prison knitting brings to life feminist and queer abolitionist visions by cultivating wellbeing, creative exchange, and communities of care. i argue that prison knitting should be understood as a form of anticarceral domesticity through which prisoners use domestic pleasures to refuse the bare life of incarceration, and to imagine new ways of being, inside the prison but not of it.
visioning [a] creative healing praxis through a 
black queer feminist lens
 ■pascale ife williams, university of  
wisconsin-madison
the machinery of white supremacy 
has inflicted [an] ecology of trauma causing much harm to the bodies, minds, and spirits of black people, particularly black women and queer folks. this necessitates the conjuring of spaces for healing, spirituality, and afrofuturistic visioning. praxes of black queer feminist organizing, cultural production and healing have emerged in black activist organizations. in byp100, safety and accountability models are being developed to reduce harm, address hurt, and support the healing process. believing [a] creative healing praxis -unapologetic blackness, creativity, radical imagination, ritual-making, the arts, and a praxis of love- are essential tools in our liberation.
“see she’s telepathic/call it black girl magic:” 
race, witchcraft, and the goth girl
 ■cheryl spinner, college of charleston
this paper shows how magic has been 
co-opted by white supremacist feminist goth culture to foster solidarity between white women. inspired by subtheme 1, i am interested in how black women reclaim their magic to construct other worlds and imaginaries. i track the black witch from tituba of the salem witch trials to janelle monae’s exclamation of “put some voodoo on it” in “tight rope” to the relatively recent the emergence of the #blackgirlmagic movement. i puf w.e.b. du bois’s assertion that black folk are gifted with clairvoyance or second sight alongside bell books explore how #blackgirlmagic expands on his theory.

panther ericka huggins and the collective 
praxis of the sisterlove collective
 ■mary phillips, lehman college
this paper traces the prison rebellions 
of former black panther party member, ericka huggins specifically the creation of her informal clandestine support group, the sisterlove collective during her incarceration at niantic state farm for newly admitted female prisoners based on the notion of community care and empowerment. her work served as transformative, but often- overlooked, example of the ways in which incarcerated women could-and did-channel various forms of inner strength.299

gws.arizona.edu time, technology and freedom in three waves 
of black girl style
 ■siobhan carter-david, southern connecticut 
state university
this paper will explore three critical 
moments in black cultural nationalism in the post-civil rights era where black women used the spirit of the times to shift the trends in hairstyling and sartorial expression explicitly toward race pride—shifts that were made possible by technological advancements, political discourse, and black feminist ideologies of the last 50 years.
play, literacy, and the pursuit of freedom: 
black girls’ literacies and the power of black women’s playscapes online
 ■latoya l. sawyer, st. john’s university
this paper explores how black women 
seek to create spaces free from oppression through the use of black girls’ literacies online. black girls’ literacies (muhammad and haddix 2016) are the ways black women and girls read and write their worlds, including play. this speaker will examine representations of black women’s discursive play online and highlight the way play creates temporal, but liberatory digital spaces. examples include the series of social media posts about black men’s desirability in the movie black panther and the hashtag #carefreeblackgirl. this presentation explores who gets to play and the implications of black women’s playscapes online.university of nebraska press

fighting the us youth sex trade
gender, race, and politics
carrie n. baker, smith college, massachusetts
publishing september 2018
paperback | 9781316649619 | $29.99
campaigns against prostitution of young people in the united states have surged and ebbed 
multiple times over the last /f_i  fty years. fighting the us youth sex trade: gender, race, and politics examines how politically and ideologically diverse activists joined together to change perceptions and public policies on youth involvement in the sex trade over time, reframing ‘juvenile prostitution’ of the 1970s as ‘commercial sexual exploitation of children’ in the 1990s, and then as ‘domestic minor sex traf/f_i  cking’ in the 2000s.
‘baker weaves a complicated tale in this extraordinary comprehensive and insightful account 
of the evolution of society’s responses to the discovery of the sexual exploitation of young people. by detailing the ways an obsession with the allegedly toxic combination of sex and youth overshadowed more systemic responses and facilitated a resort to the criminal justice system, the author highlights politicians’ tendency to overlook societal contexts and conditions and focus on individual behavior. recommended for everyone interested in law, policy, and politics.’

why does patriarchy persist?
carol gilligan and naomi snider
‘taking on the long brewing battle between true democracy 
and the pervasive ‘ghost’ of patriarchy, this com pact book 
exists in a cat egory of its own. the voices of its authors  
are accessible, incisive and engaging—the perfect book  to launch almost any conversation a bout our current  
socio-political times.’
jill gentile, author, feminine law: freud, free   
speech, and the voice of desire
one-dimensional 
queer
roderick a. ferguson
‘one-dimensional queer is 
as clear an account as you could hope to encounter of how r ace and sexuality 
came to be understood as separate formations in  us history.’
jack halberstam, 
columbia university
 
 xenofeminism
helen hester 
‘this is without doubt one of the most exciting texts i have read for quite some time. lucid, well-grounded and brilliantly original, this short book is a breath of fresh air.’
claire colebrook,
pennsylvania state university
  seduction
men, masculinity and mediated intimacy
rachel o’neill
‘this is a brave work   of feminist sexual  politics that provides an  unﬂ inching look into   
the seduction industry.’
rebecca sullivan, 
university of calgary
